                        "background_details": "\nPre-history\nBitcoin borrows from nearly three decades of research by academics, cypherpunk practitioners, and hobbyists who tried to create similar payment protocols. Some of the most prominent projects that preceded Bitcoin include: Digicash, b-money, Hashcash, e-gold, and Bit Gold. Bitcoin is often associated with Austrian economic theories, anarcho-capitalist principles, and general libertarian politicking by virtue of the exclusive developer community to whom Nakamoto first released their white paper, certain protocol design characteristics, and the political affiliations of early Bitcoin investors. \n\nConception to Launch\nOn October 31, 2008, at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis, just six weeks after the infamous investment bank, Lehman Brothers, declared bankruptcy, the pseudonymous <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/satoshi-nakamoto\">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> released the Bitcoin whitepaper to the cryptography mailing list. Titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\", the whitepaper proposed a new electronic cash system that would allow fully peer-to-peer online payments without reliance on trusted third parties. Soon after the release of the whitepaper, Satoshi implemented the Bitcoin software as open-source code. On 3 January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi mining the genesis block of Bitcoin, which included a now-famous \"The Times\" headline in the <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/coinbase-transaction\">coinbase</a> both to prove the network’s fair launch and to make a political statement about the global financial system. The event marked the birth of the world's first non-sovereign, decentralized, digital money.\n\nPost Launch\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/hal-finney\">Hal Finney</a>, who invented the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004, received the first Bitcoin transaction (10 bitcoins) on January 12, 2009. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/laszlo-hanyecz\">Laszlo Hanyecz</a> bought two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. \n\nIn August 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted and exploited in the Bitcoin network, allowing users to create an infinite amount of bitcoins. The transactions exploiting the vulnerability were quickly spotted and erased for the Bitcoin blockchain, with the vulnerability being patched in a network upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.\n\nIn December 2010, amidst rising publicity from Bitcoin's use in financing Wikileaks, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared from involvement with Bitcoin. It is unknown why Satoshi disappeared from the project, although some believe Satoshi, cognizant of past struggles to launch a digital currency, recognized that a leader of the Bitcoin project could be a central point of failure. It is estimated that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/gavin-andresen\">Gavin Andresen</a>.\n\nSilk Road & Mt. Gox\nOne of the most iconic early use cases for Bitcoin was the Silk Road. Launched in early 2011, the Silk Road was a darknet marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell a wide variety of goods including, most notably, illegal drugs. Underpinning the Silk Road was the Tor network, which allowed users to browse the Silk Road anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring, and Bitcoin which provided a censorship-resistant payment rail for pseudonymous transactions. Over the course of its life, it is estimated that the Silk Road facilitated more than $1.2 billion in transactions, collecting over $80 million in sales commissions, leveraging the Bitcoin network as its payment rail. The site was shut down in 2013 when the FBI took advantage of the Silk Road’s centralized infrastructure, arresting founder <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/ross-ulbricht\">Ross Ulbricht</a>, and shuttering the site.\n\nFounded by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb\">Jed McCaleb</a> in July 2010, and led by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/mark-karpeles\">Mark Karpeles</a> until it collapsed, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/mtgox\">Mt. Gox</a> was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges in the world. Based in Tokyo, Japan, the exchange would go on to handle over 70% of all bitcoin (BTC) transactions worldwide at its peak. Known for its chronic security issues, Mt. Gox was infamously hacked in 2014, losing 850,000 bitcoins worth about $450 million at the time. The hack sent the price of Bitcoin, which was in the midst of one of its first major price bubbles, plummeting. Bitcoin would sink into a bear market with prices not recovering until the 2017 bull run.\n\n2017 Bubble & Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork\nThe 2017 price bubble was a watershed moment for Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1900% from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year to near $20,000 at its peak in December. At its peak, Bitcoin's market capitalization eclipsed $325 billion. Along with the proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings, powered by Ethereum, Bitcoin's incredible 2017 run propelled cryptocurrency into mainstream consciousness, among the most discussed phenomena of 2017.\n\nAlso notable in 2017, Bitcoin experienced its <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\">most contentious fork to date</a>. Amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly divergent views on scaling Bitcoin, an agreement was reached amongst prominent Bitcoin stakeholders in what is now known as the \"New York Agreement\". The agreement was to support a set of network upgrades called SegWit2x. The proposal was backed by over 80% of Bitcoin's hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/segregated-witness\">SegWit</a> without the 2MB block size increase, the philosophy underpinning this decision being that the users controlled the network, not miners and Bitcoin businesses. Subsequently, they set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017, they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. These events marked, one end, a landmark demonstration of power by the users of the Bitcoin network, and on the other end, the first great schism within the Bitcoin community.\n\n2018 - 2019\nAfter peaking in December 2017, Bitcoin, along with the rest of the cryptocurrency market in January 2018, crashed, sending the cryptocurrency market into its latest bear market. Since then Bitcoin has dropped as low as $3,200, more than 80% below its ATH. However, while prices have yet to recover to 2017 highs, the institutionalization of Bitcoin has picked up significantly. Traditional Wall Street institutions including Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, and Fidelity have all launched cryptocurrency offerings, opening up the market to institutional investors. There are now several regulated exchanges and custodians. Furthermore, regulatory clarity around Bitcoin has improved dramatically with SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, revealing at a Congressional hearing in February 2018, that the SEC does not consider Bitcoin to be a security.\n\nSince it reached its cycle low in February 2019, Bitcoin's price has recovered considerably, rising as high as $13,000 in June. With the recent announcements of Facebook's Libra project and China's Central Bank digital currency, governments and multinational corporations around the world have begun to look at cryptocurrencies more seriously. American officials are debating a digital dollar and lawmakers around the world are considering the central bank digital currency (CBDC) options. Furthermore, there have been numerous cryptocurrency-related hearings since Libra was announced. China has recently <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/china-blockchain-madness\">announced</a> blockchain was a revolutionary technology and that it would make blockchain technology a strategic imperative for the country. Bitcoin's price rose more than 40% after the announcement, its highest intraday movement since 2011.\n\n2020 - 2021\nBitcoin traded sideways into 2020, but the onset of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic saw world markets take the biggest dips since at least the 2007-08 Mortgage Crisis. Bitcoin did not escape the dip – in less than 48 hours it lost half of its value, going below $4,000 for the first time since March of 2019. Luckily for bitcoiners, bitcoin rebounded, returning to its pre-pandemic price in less than a month.\n\nBitcoin’s ascent recovery out of the March turmoil drew wider media and institutional attention and lent credibility to its store of value narrative. Although it remained around $10,000 throughout Ethereum’s firey <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/a-data-driven-look-at-the-end-of-defi-s-summer\">DeFi summer</a>, bitcoin would start to trend upwards into the fall and by early November bitcoin hit $14,000. Whether it was unprecedented levels of money printing by the Federal Reserve, its V-shaped recovery in April, or direct stimulus payments to millions of Americans, it was clear bitcoin wasn’t done at $14,000 as it crossed $20,000 for the first time ever on December 16, 2020. Two weeks later it hit $28,000. Then, on January 8, 2021, bitcoin set a new all-time high of $41,429.38. Since hitting $41,000 bitcoin has mostly drifted in the $30,000.\n\nBitcoin’s price wasn’t the only thing rapidly accelerating in 2020. Institutional adoption skyrocketed. Led by Paul Tudor Jones of Microstrategy (  $1 billion), institutions joined the bitcoin world en masse. From insurance companies like MassMutual ($100 million) to investment firms like Ruffer ($744 million) new groups <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-potential-impact-of-increased-capital-allocation-to-bitcoin\">continue</a> to adopt bitcoin. And institutions aren’t alone – entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and politicians like Miami Mayor Francis Suarez have increasingly promoted bitcoin. Even athletes have joined the space, as NFL player Russell Okung partnered with Bitcoin Lightning Company <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/zap\">Zap</a> to become the first professional sports player ever to be paid in bitcoin\n\n",

Users rejected this proposal and deployed a user-activated soft fork in a demonstration that users controlled the Bitcoin network.\n\nBIP 141 defined a new structure called a \"witness\" that is committed to blocks separately from the transaction Merkle tree. This structure contains data required to check transaction validity but not required to determine transaction effects. In particular, scripts and signatures are moved into this new structure.\nBIP 143 defines a new transaction digest algorithm for signature verification in version 0 witness program, in order to minimize redundant data hashing in verification and to cover the input value by the signature\nBIP 147 proposed changes to the Bitcoin transaction validity rules to fix a malleability vector in the extra stack element consumed by OPCHECKMULTISIG and OPCHECKMULTISIGVERIFY\nBIP 148 Defined soft fork flag day activation of the segregated witness deployment known as \"segwit\". Activated BIP141, BIP143, and BIP147. The date was set for August 1, 2017, when users would decide whether or not to deploy SegWit"

As a replacement for currency, that has been determined by most people to not be a security.\n\n  Then there are tokens, which are used to finance projects. I've been on the record saying there are very few, there's none that I've seen, tokens that aren't securities.

A network of mining and economic <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\">nodes</a> maintains this ledger by validating, propagating, and fighting to include <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/mempool\">mempool</a> transactions in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain’s work.\n\nMining difficulty regularly adjusts to maintain Bitcoin's average ten-minute block schedule. Mining nodes add new blocks to whatever chain has the largest accumulated proof of work maintained by a network of economic nodes with downloaded copies of the same chain.\n\nLearn More:\nBitcoin Developer's Guide\nMastering Bitcoin",

                    "governance_details": "Model Overview\nBitcoin governance is the process by which protocol rules are decided upon, implemented, and enforced. Users (full nodes) adopt new rules according to their subjective views on what Bitcoin is and should be. If two or more individuals adopt the same set of rules, they form an inter-subjective social consensus of what “Bitcoin” is. It is in this respect that many conceptualize Bitcoin as being set by a social contract. Every time rule changes are contemplated, the rules of the contract are decided and renegotiated continuously between stakeholders. Protocol changes are legitimized when users agree to adopt the new changes. Once adopted, the Bitcoin protocol automates the enforcement of the social contract.\n\nProcess Overview\nProtocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open-source Bitcoin community can submit <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip\">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals</a> (\"BIPs\"). After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Bitcoin Core maintainers merge code changes into Bitcoin Core's GitHub Repository. Once new code has been implemented into the Bitcoin Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.\n\nOnce rules are adopted on-chain, all new transactions and block proposals are subject to the agreed-upon rules. Full nodes only accept new transactions and block proposals that are valid according to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Anything that is not valid will be rejected. Thus, miners must implement the prevailing rules of the network in order to participate in the block creation process. \n\nUser Activated Hard Fork\n2017's <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\">User Activated Soft Fork Event</a> provided an illustrative case study on Bitcoin governance in practice. \n\nAs early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around block size began. These discussions largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. In May 2017, a meeting between miners, businesses, investors, and core developers took place at the Consensus conference in New York, in what is now referred to as the \"New York Agreement\". The product of this meeting was an agreement to support <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\">SegWit</a> (a soft fork) and a 2MB block size (hard fork). \n\nKnown as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. This plan was proposed as BIP 148, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, from a pseudonymous developer named <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/shaolin-fry\">Shaolinfry</a>. Soon after, users set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Eventually, enough nodes signaled support for it, forcing miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. \n\nMany see this user-activated soft fork (UASF) as a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history. The philosophy underpinning the event was that users controlled the network, not miners. The event not only illustrated the balance of power within Bitcoin's network, but also calmed suspicions that parties such as miners, businesses, or Bitcoin Core developers, controlled Bitcoin. \n\nLearn More: \nBitcoin Governance\nUnpacking Bitcoin's Social Contract\nWho Controls Bitcoin Core?\nBitcoin Miners Beware: Invalid Blocks Need Not Apply",

                        "background_details": "Conception to token sale\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> conceived Ethereum in 2013, after what he perceived as limitations in the functionality of Bitcoin’s scripting language, namely the lack of Turing completeness. Buterin published the first Ethereum white paper later that year, describing a distributed computing platform for executing smart contracts and building <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>. In 2014, Buterin and some other early contributors founded the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\">Ethereum Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum’s research, core protocol development, and ecosystem growth. The foundation's first task was to host the Ethereum crowdsale, which raised 31,529 <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">BTC</a> (~$18 million at the time) in exchange for about 60 million ether, and use the proceeds to fund the network's initial development. The Ethereum Foundation continues to be the primary funding organization, issuing grants to research teams and projects focused on Ethereum.\n\nThe rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs)\nEthereum's mainnet launched in July 2015, with the first live release known as Frontier. Shortly thereafter, Augur (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/augur\">REP</a>) conducted the first <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/initial-coin-offering-ico\">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a>, in which the startup sold its Ethereum-based REP tokens (created via the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\">ERC-20</a> standard) to help fund the project. The ability to develop and sell a newly generated token to help raise capital became an attractive method of fundraising because projects could circumvent the legal policies and costs required from traditional companies (until more recently). Ethereum-focused startups created thousands of new tokens since Augur's ICO, raising billions of dollars in the process.\n\nThe DAO hack\nIn April 2016, a decentralized venture fund known as <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/the-dao\">The DAO</a> hosted an ICO, raising ~$150 million in ETH in the process. A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the guilty party to siphon 3.6 million ETH. A significant portion of the Ethereum community opted to revert the chain to remove The DAO and its subsequent hack from the network's history. The remaining stakeholders held the preservation of immutability in higher regard and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide in the community led to a contentious hard fork a few weeks post-hack, causing a permanent split in the network. The legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history is now known as Ethereum Classic (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic\">$ETC</a>).\n\nThe path to scalability: Ethereum 2.0\nScalability is a known limitation for the current state of Ethereum. Periods of high user activity, as seen during the CryptoKitties launch in Nov. 2017 and the DeFi bonanza during the Summer of 2020, can cause transaction times and fees to skyrocket, which often prices out retail users and newcomers.\n\nThe potential shortcomings of Ethereum's current design are nothing new to Ethereum developers. Various teams have been working since the launch of Ethereum to upgrade the network to account for better scalability and security measures without compromising the community's values of decentralization. The current plan is to swap Ethereum's consensus layer from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and implement a scaling technique known as sharding in a massive upgrade called Serenity (also referred to as Ethereum 2.0).\n\nEthereum developers have broken down this upgrade into three or more phases to minimize complexity as they add more features. The first phase Phase 0 has a minimum launch date of Dec. 1, 2020. It will bring the Beacon Chain (the backbone of Ethereum 2.0) to life and enable the network to bootstrap a stable of validators to ensure network security. The following phases are being developed in parallel but might take several years before they reach completion.",

The core developers concluded, \"there's no major reason do it now\" because the difficulty bomb is only necessary once Ethereum 2.0 and its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism are activated. Overlooking an Ice Age EIP for now also prevents any further delays in Berlin's development phase.\n\nCore devs and the greater Ethereum community also excludes the EIP-1057, the proposal for the now-infamous ProgPoW (short for Progressive Proof-of-Work). It aimed to alter Ethereum's hashing algorithm to close the performance efficiency gap between generalized and specialized mining hardware (otherwise known as ASICs).

Those block rewards incentivize miners to secure the network. Miners that find an uncle block also receive 87.5% of the base block reward. Uncle blocks occur when several distinct miners simultaneously mine a block. In this case, the block that has the most accumulated PoW is conserved, and others are rejected. Unlike the Bitcoin chain that does not reward miners for orphan blocks, the Ethereum chain does reward uncle block miners. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncle block miners. As <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> notes, the initial intent behind rewarding uncle block miners was to avoid mining centralization caused by the network lag that smaller miners could endure:\n  \"This mechanic was originally introduced to reduce centralization pressures, by reducing the advantage that well-connected miners have over poorly connected miners.\"\n\nIn 2017, the difficulty bomb increased block times drastically, thus reducing the issuance rate. Indeed, the difficulty bomb, also known as \"ice age\" was initially designed as a mechanism to disincentivize miners to continue mining the Ethereum chain by making it exponentially harder to create a new block. This was meant to accelerate the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe Casper development and transition to Proof-of-Stake being delayed, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/afri-schoedon\">Afri Schoeden</a> proposed to delay the difficulty bomb and reduce the block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether, thus leaving the system in the same general state as before. This proposal, EIP 649, was included in the Byzantium hard fork which was implemented on October 16, 2017, at block 4,370,000, thus effectively reducing block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether and delaying the difficulty bomb for approximately 1.4 years.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, at block 7,280,000, the Constantinople hard fork further reduced block rewards from 3 Ether to 2 Ether, and once again delayed the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months with EIP 1234.\n\nThe Ethereum's Parity multi-sig wallet bug\n\nOn November 06, 2017, a vulnerability in the \"library\" smart contract code was exploited by an anonymous user. Subsequently, the user destroyed the library contract. This destruction locked forever a total amount of 513,774.16 Ether located in 587 multi-signatures parity wallets. <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-proprietary-methods\">Messari Proprietary Methodology</a> to calculate liquid supply excludes any non-transferable coins. Thus, these locked Ether are considered illiquid and are not included in our liquid supply calculation.\n\nETH 2.0 and the transition to Casper Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn ETH 2.0, the Ethereum chain will be maintained via a new proof-of-stake system, where rewards will be distributed on a sliding scale based on the total amount staked on the network. The more total supply that’s staked, the higher the system-wide issuance rate (to incentivize high cumulative participation). Although individual yields will decline as the staking participation increases. A table posted by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> on Github lays out the sliding scale issuance rate. \n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/justin-drake\">Justin Drake</a>, a researcher at the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\">Ethereum Foundation</a>, argued that targeting 30,000,000 ETH at stake, long-term, “seems about right for strong security.” It would represent about 30% of the network and result in an approximate 3% annual inflation. Nevertheless, the penalties applied to validators going offline as well as the slashing penalties and the transaction fees burnt due to EIP 1559 will lead to the destruction of Ether, thus reducing the total net issuance amount.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake will occur in three or four stages, according to the latest specifications shared by the core developers:\nPhase 0, expected for Dec. 1, 2020, will initially increase issuance compared to the current level. This is due to the fact that both the Proof-of-Work and Beacon Chain will run simultaneously and rewards will be distributed on both chains, although the staking participation, and thus annual issuance on the Beacon Chain, will most likely be very low during this Phase.\nPhase 1, expected for Q4 2021, will allow finalizing the Proof-of-Work chain with Proof-of-Stake. The Proof-of-Work rewards will most likely be reduced to match an issuance rate between 0.5% and 1% (versus 4.5% before Phase 1). Both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake rewards will co-exist and the global issuance rate should be around 1% at that stage.\nPhase 1.5, estimated for 2022, will mark when Ethereum 2.0 transfers will likely unlock, giving stakers access to their previously inaccessible staked ETH and accumulated rewards. These rewards and staking amounts will date back to the launch of the Beacon Chain.\nPhase 2, estimated for 2023, will progressively lead to an increase of staking participation, thus increasing the annual issuance rate, while Proof-of-Work will simultaneously progressively disappear.\n\n",

Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single mining pool could obtain a majority of the hashpower on a given chain.\n\nThe GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including orphan blocks in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain by weighing the parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.\n\nSome say GHOST works better in theory than in practice, claiming Ethereum further modified its consensus implementation before (or soon after) launch to avoid security complications. Others suggest the Ethereum consensus model better resembles Nakamoto consensus or a modified version of the Inclusive protocol. But the inclusion of EIP-100 in the Byzantium fork changed Ethereum's difficulty calculation algorithm to include orphan blocks, which indicates the proposed modified GHOST implementation is intact. Regardless of the security model classification, Ethereum continues to reward orphan block miners with 87.5% of the base block reward.\n\nMining\nEthereum miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash, using the Keccak-256 and Keccak-512 hash functions, as defined by Ethereum's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Unlike Bitcoin's biweekly adjustments, Ethereum recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.\n\nCryptographers designed Ethash to be <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\">ASIC</a>-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. The majority of the Ethereum remains opposed to ASIC miners, as evidenced by its support for the ProgPoW EIP (a likely inclusion in the second Istanbul hard fork). Ethereum also plans to transition to a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> consensus model, which would render any mining equipment obsolete.",

External contracts can create and sign messages to send to both types of accounts, while contract accounts can only execute transactions automatically in response to a message they have received. The latter are what are known as <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\">smart contracts</a> and enable the programmability of <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine\nThe heart of the Ethereum blockchain is known as the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/ethereum-virtual-machine\">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a>, which is the part of the protocol that executes transactions. It is a Turing complete virtual machine featuring a specific language “EVM bytecode,” typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum node operators and miners provide these scarce resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas. Different operations require different amounts of gas, and the user can specify how much they are willing to pay in ETH for each unit of gas. The amount of gas required for the transaction, along with the price paid, becomes the transaction cost. Every transaction also had a gas limit to prevent attacks from overloading blocks, which could slow down block production.\n\nDeveloper tools and token standards\nEthereum adopted <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\">Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) 20</a> in late 2015 as a standard for Ethereum smart contracts to issue tokens on the platform. The majority of tokens built on Ethereum are ERC-20 compliant, meaning they follow a standard set of rules defining how they are created and used. Another more popular token rule set is ERC-721 with standardizes the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) where any given token is distinguishable from another making them popular for gaming.\n\nEthereum 2.0\nAs Ethereum transitions to Eth 2.0, it will undergo significant changes to its design. It will transition from <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work</a> to <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\">Proof-of-Stake</a> and feature a sharding architecture. Currently, nodes must validate every transaction to maintain an updated global state. The new sharding model segments the network into various groups (called shards) and randomly assigns nodes to each shard. Rather than having to monitor the entire chain, nodes only have to validate their respective shard(s). Individual shards shared their transaction details with the Beacon Chain, which acts as the backbone of Ethereum 2.0. The Beacon Chain serves to validate the transactions on each shard, helping the entire network reach consensus. It also identifies dishonest validators and initiates penalties in the form of slashing, in which a portion of a validator's stake is removed from circulation. Eth 2.0 will also replace the EVM with Ethereum WebAssembly (eWASM), which intends to translate coding logic more efficiently and help improve Ethereum’s scalability.",

The attack reduced the rate of block production by 50-66% as block validation times ballooned to 20-60 seconds (as opposed to 12-14 seconds).\n\nIn response, Ethereum developers opted to initiate a hard fork at block 2463000 (Oct. 18, 2016) to implement EIP-150, which addressed the issue of underpriced operation codes to make future DDoS attacks cost-prohibitive.

                        "background_details": "Founded in July 2014 by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/brock-pierce\">Brock Pierce</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/craig-sellars\">Craig Sellars</a>, and <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/reeve-collins\">Reeve Collins</a>, Tether (USDT), originally known as \"Realcoin\", is a cryptocurrency commonly known as a “<a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/stablecoins\">stablecoin</a>” that aims to keep a fixed 1:1 exchange ratio with the U.S. dollar. Tether was one of the earliest stablecoins created, built upon Mastercoin (Omni), which was a protocol layer for Bitcoin that introduced the stablecoin concept to the world in 2012. Tether pioneered what is now known as a fiat-collateralized stablecoin model, and is now the most widely used stablecoin today.\n\nTether was created as an attempt to solve two major issues with existing cryptocurrencies: high volatility and convertibility between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To address these perceived issues Tether created a cryptocurrency that is fully backed 1:1 by deposits of U.S. dollars held at banks. On Ethereum, USDT tokens are represented as ERC-20 tokens, while on Bitcoin, Tether utilizes the Omni layer, to represent USDT tokens. While the tokens themselves operate in a decentralized network, Hong Kong based <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/tether-limited\">Tether Ltd</a> is solely responsible for creating and redeeming tokens as well as maintaining the 1:1 deposit backing. \n\nExchanges have been the primary users of USDT as an alternative to fiat currencies, reducing or eliminating the need to maintain outside banking relationships. Notable exchanges that utilize the token include <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/bittrex\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/binance-holdings-ltd\">Binance</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/coinbase\">Coinbase</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/kraken\">Kraken</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/huobi\">Huobi</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/poloniex\">Poloniex</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/liquid\">Liquid.io</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/gate-io\">Gate.io</a>, and <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/okex\">OKEx</a>. Tether Ltd shares many executives and has strong ties with Hong Kong based Bitfinex with both sharing the same parent organization <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ifinex-inc\">iFinex Inc</a>.\n\nSince its founding in 2014, Tether has been the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/history-of-tether\">subject of ongoing controversy </a>due to the failure of Tether to provided audited financial statements proving it has adequate reserves backing USDT. Historically Tether has failed to disclose its banking relationships, only recently announcing its banking partners in November 2018 to quell rumors about its solvency raised by associated crypto exchange, Bitfinex.\n\nIn March 2019, Tether updated its disclosure statement claiming that its tokens are no longer backed 100% by U.S. dollar deposits. Tether is instead now backed 100% backed by reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.

Days after the NYAG's action, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel for Bitfinex and Tether, filed an affidavit confirming that Tether was backed by only 74% cash and equivalents with the rest being equity in iFinex.\n\nIn May 2019, Bitfinex and Tether CTO, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/paolo-ardoino\">Paulo Ardoino</a> announced Bitfinex had successfully raised $1 billion in a token sale, with proceeds used to cover the $850 million in (potentially) lost funds from Crypto Capital.",

The project was launched out of the insight that the industry needed a fiat-collateralized stablecoin with strong governance and transparency, in contrast to <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/tether\">Tether</a>. USDC attempts to solve these issues by publishing a monthly public attestation of 100% reserves of fiat tokens on CENTRE.io, and providing clear rules and guidelines for CENTRE members regarding USDC issuance and redemption. Furthermore to become an issuer within the CENTRE consortium members must follow key membership and operating rules which include licensing, compliance, technology & operations, accounting, and custody of fiat reserves.\n\nExchanges have been the primary users of USDC as an alternative to fiat currencies, outsourcing the need to maintain banking relationships. Furthermore, USDC is one of the only fiat-collateralized stablecoins available for use in the burgeoning <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-finance-defi\">DeFi</a> ecosystem.",

USDC relies on a proof-of-reserves system to ensure that reserve assets match circulating tokens. \n\nCENTRE contracts manage the minting and the redemption/burning of stablecoins, which can be used for both the exchange and wallet interoperability use cases. Customers who on-board through a stablecoin on-ramp, such as a web application created and maintained by a licensed CENTRE token-issuing member, can transfer fiat funds into that CENTRE issuer’s account. The issuer then executes a series of commands with the CENTRE network to verify, mint, and validate fiat tokens pegged to the value of those deposited funds. The customer can then transfer those tokens elsewhere in order to use them. Redemption follows the reverse sequence: fiat tokens are burned when a customer visits an off-ramp such as a web application maintained by a licensed CENTRE issuing member. Upon successful verification and validation, funds from underlying fiat reserves would be transferred to the customer’s external bank.\n",

Binance Coin is an ERC-20 token that was issued as part of an initial coin offering (ICO) to be used for discounted trading costs, with a percentage of the tokens burned every quarter.\n\nERC-20 tokens were replaced by native tokens when Binance launched Binance Chain, its own public blockchain, in April 2019. The team constructed Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange that allows traders to keep custody of their cash, on top of Binance Chain. Over time, the token has gained additional functionality, such as use in the Binance Launchpad lottery system and different payments in the Binance ecosystem.\n\nCEO Changpeng Zhao (\"CZ\") has also stated that 90% of Binance employees opt to earn a portion of their income in BNB.",

Initially, the sales were done on a first come first serve basis. They since pivoted to a lottery system where users can claim tickets based on the number of BNB tokens held over the prior 20 days. The tickets represent a certain allocation of tokens and are drawn randomly. If selected, the user is committed to purchasing that number of tokens at the listed price. \n\nBinance Chain\nBNB acts as the native token used as gas to pay for network transactions on Binance Chain, a high-performance blockchain network. It initially operates with a small pre-selected validator set, but the plan is to transition to a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/delegated-proof-of-stake\">delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS)</a> consensus mechanism where users can vote using their BNB for delegates that will validate blocks to secure the network. There is also a built-in governance module to let BNB holders submit proposals by depositing tokens which are then voted on. \n"

Binance plans to burn 100 million BNB (50% of supply) over time and has successfully executed nine coin burns to date.\nInvestors receive 20 million BNB (10% of supply) with no vesting or lock-up restrictions. \nThe public sale distributed 100 million BNB (50% of supply). Binance launched the ERC-20 Binance Coin in a public sale on July 14, 2017. Half of the funds raised through Binance’s coin offering were intended for Binance branding and marketing, and roughly one-third of the funds were for platform upgrades and development.\n\nBinance executed the token swap from ERC-20 BNB tokens to Binance chain mainnet BNB coins on April 23, 2019.

Nevertheless, in April 2019, Binance edited the white paper’s section devoted to quarterly repurchasing plans to replace it with a section on quarterly burn plans. In July 2019, Binance announced that it will burn the BNB tokens allocated to the Binance team going forward. As a result, the team allocation, that was initially supposed to be vesting for 4 years, will remain illiquid until all 80,000,000 BNB have been burnt. This reduces BNB's liquid supply, as these tokens are no longer liquid, but it also reduces the potential liquid supply inflation rate that would have occurred through the vesting of those tokens. \n\nAs of today, Binance has realized 15 quarterly token burns, leading to the destruction of 30,567,063 BNB:\n\nOctober 2017 - 986,000 BNB\nJanuary 2018 -  1,821,586 BNB\nApril 2018 -  2,220,314 BNB\nJuly 2018 -  2,528,767 BNB\nOctober 2018 - 1,643,986 BNB\nJanuary 2019 - 1,623,818 BNB.\nApril 2019 - 829,888 BNB\nJuly 2019 - 808,888 BNB\nOctober 2019 - 2,061,888 BNB\n10.

                        "background_details": "Founded in 2012 by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/chris-larsen\">Chris Larsen</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb\">Jed McCaleb</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\">Ripple</a> (Formerly known as Opencoin) is a technology company that develops the Ripple payment protocol. Ripple enables banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges, and corporations to send money globally using blockchain technology. Leveraging the prior work of <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/ryan-fugger\">Ryan Fugger</a>, in 2012 Ripple created the XRP Ledger (formerly known as Ripple Consensus Ledger), an open-source cryptographic ledger powered by a peer-to-peer network of nodes. XRP is the native asset of the XRP ledger.\n\nIn 2004, Ryan Fugger founded RipplePay, a financial technology company aiming to create a peer-to-peer payments network. Separately, in 2011, a team of Jed McCaleb began the development of a new consensus network for digital currencies that would ultimately become the XRP Ledger. Later Chris Larsen, <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-schwartz\">David Schwartz</a>, and Arthur Britto, would join the project, and in 2012 McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan about RipplePay. After discussion with the RipplePay community Ryan handed over the project to McCaleb and Larsen, and in September 2012 they founded Opencoin (re-branded to Ripple Labs in 2013). \n\nIn 2013 Ripple released XRP, a native token on the Ripple Consensus Ledger. At launch, it created 100 billion XRP tokens of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. Over the course of 2013, Ripple would raise over $7.5 million from some of the most prestigious venture firms in the united states. Later that year Jed McCaleb would leave the company over internal disputes around the company's vision and would ultimately go on to found Stellar.\n\nAfter the initial release of the XRP Ledger, Ripple focused its efforts on getting financial institutions to use the ledger to process remittances. Entering the cross border payments market led to regulatory scrutiny, with FinCEN fining Ripple Inc for violating the bank secrecy act in 2015. As part of the remedial plan related to the fine, Ripple Inc agreed to enhance the anti-money laundering capabilities of the XRP protocol and stricter permissioning requirements were added for additional participants to join the network.\n\nTo further enhance the credibility of XRP as a partner for traditional financial institutions, Ripple obtained a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitlicense\">BitLicense</a> from the State of New York in 2016. The upside of these enhancements and engagement with regulators was it gave XRP the capability to more deeply integrate with the traditional financial system. \n\nToday XRP's primary use is as a bridge currency underpinning <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\">Ripple</a>'s xRapid product, an on-demand liquidity solution. xRapid allows financial institutions to exchange value between fiat currencies through a network a digital asset exchanges that use XRP as a bridge currency for its liquidity.\n\nTo date Ripple has raised over $120 million in venture funding, and XRP is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization. Ripple and its founding team own the substantial majority of the XRP supply of which Ripple the company programmatically sells on a quarterly basis. Since 2016 Ripple has sold over $1.1 billion worth of XRP and XRP sales remain Ripple's dominant source of revenue (and controversy).\n\n",

Jed McCaleb donated 2 billion of his allocation to a donor-advised fund. In 2014 McCaleb negotiated an exit agreement from the project dictating his remaining allocation would be held in a custodial account and released to him on a monthly schedule. A daily cap on the amount he can sell of the tokens released is included in the agreement. Today, Ripple’s selling restrictions on co-founder Jed McCaleb allow him to sell his allocation at a theoretical maximum rate of 1% of daily trading volume.\n\n"

Nevertheless, XRP liquid and circulating supply are massively inflationary. \n\nIn December 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP into escrow in order to alleviate concerns that a massive amount of XRP could hit the market all at once with substantial negative price impact. 1 billion is being released monthly to support Ripple’s ongoing operation of Ripplenet. Any unused funds are returned to escrow at the end of the month. On average Ripple re-escrows 700 million and 300 million XRP become liquid each month.\n\nRipple generated revenue from ongoing XRP sales, which account for well over 90% of the company's revenue. There are two types of XRP sales that the company discloses:\nProgrammatic sales: These come from the company’s XRP reserve, and can be sold at a rate of no more than 0.25% of average daily volume on defined exchanges. \nDirect sales from XRP II: These come from direct bespoke deals with institutional clients, and include (per Ripple’s 2016-2017 disclosures) reselling restrictions to ensure its partners do not purchase XRP at a discount from the company and then immediately flood the market with sales.\n\nRipple has sold over 1.2 billion USD worth of XRP through Direct Sales and Programmatic Sales. \n\nOur liquid supply curve takes into account the Ripple Escrow mechanism as well as the Founder' selling agreement to calculate liquid supply. As such, even though XRP's outstanding supply is deflationary over time through fee-burning, circulating and liquid supply are massively inflationary due to escrow release, founder's distributions, and Ripple sales. At the current burn rate, it would take 20 years for the XRP Ledger to burn what is distributed by Ripple and its founders every day. \n\nTo date, Messari released to in-depth research on Ripple supply management:\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/xrp-market-cap-may-be-6-1-billion-overstated\">XRP Market Cap may be $6.1 billion overstated</a>\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-research-circulating-supply-study-for-xrp\">Circulating Supply Study for XRP</a>",

A supermajority of validators is required for the network to arrive at consensus to validate transactions initiated across the network.\n\nRipple Inc, has focused on integrating user verification protocols so network participants are able to define which users they trust and how much they trust them. This has the effect of causing transactions to “ripple” across the network. Because if two users without a direct relationship initiate a transaction across the network. It ripples outward finding a path linking the users together from their trusted relationships to complete the transaction. \n\nFor users just getting started, Ripple Inc. maintains a unique node list users can select by default representing validators with a history of reliably operating on the XRP network.\n\nCross-currency transactions typically take 3 – 5 seconds to process across the ledger. Once initiated, XRP’s pathfinding algorithm identifies the quickest least expensive way to complete the transaction. Generally, for the pathfinding algorithm to work optimally, a large number of market makers need to be operating on the network so sufficient liquidity is available to efficiently complete transactions.\n\nTo encourage the development of a robust ecosystem around the ledger, XRP maintains a variety of APIs to help nodes and other third parties interact with it based on the REST API standard. Invoicing and wallet solutions allow businesses to incorporate it as a payment option for their customers.\n",

The requests for purchase and redemption of BUSD results in movement of cash in and out of the reserve, which in turn has the supplyController address mint and burn tokens accordingly. For example, purchase of $100 will result in issuance of 100 BUSD tokens and $100 being deposited into the reserve. On the other hand, redemption of 100 BUSD tokens results in destruction of those 100 tokens and withdrawal of $100 from the reserve to be given to the redeemer. As a resort to critical security threat, Paxos can pause transfer and approval of BUSD tokens via OpenZeppelin’s contracts.\n\nAlthough the creation and destruction of the tokens occur through Paxos, other transactions in BUSD follow ERC-20 smart contracts. This ensures security for BUSD, as it gets rid of the need for third parties and instead relies on the long-tested global blockchain network. Additionally, trading tokens is simple with BUSD because viewing and transferring of BUSD is automatically supported by most Ethereum-supporting exchanges and wallet applications.\n\nDue to the Trust Charter, the New York State Department of Financial Services regulates and monitors the company and its operating procedures to make sure it follows New York banking laws. These banking laws also requires Paxos to have the power to freeze accounts as well as wipe the balance of said frozen accounts. BUSD has a function called “setLawEnforcementRole.” As its name implies, it can give administrative permissions over the circulating BUSD supply. Paxos has assured that the function is for preventing illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing and that it will not be used unless required by law.",

In blockchains like Bitcoin and Etheruem, one of the limitations to scalability is the time required to reach a consensus on the order of transactions. Anatoly believed his new technique could automate the transaction ordering process for blockchains, providing a key piece that would enable crypto networks to scale well-beyond their capabilities at the time.\n\nAnatoly later teamed up with former Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald to build a single blockchain network in Rust that used PoH as its \"internal clock.\" The two released the first internal testnet (with demo) and official version of the project's whitepaper in Feb. 2018. Another former Qualcomm cohort, Stephen Akridge, suggested that offloading signature verification to graphics processors could further increase transaction throughput (i.e., scalability). Anatoly recruited Greg and Stephen, and three others to found the company that would eventually become Solana Labs. The founding team included former Apple engineers in addition to the Qualcomm veterans. They initially named the project Loom but later rebranded it to Solana to avoid confusion with the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, Loom Network.\n\nSolana Labs began raising funds to build its new crypto network in Q2 2018. Between Apr. 2018 and Jul. 2019, the team raised a little over $20 million in various private token sales. They announced the sales as a single Series A in late-July 2019. The fundraising effort ran parallel to Solana's work on the protocol, which went through several permissioned testnet phases before the team announced its public incentivized testnet, called Tour de SOL, in Q3 2020. The first stage of Tour de SOL went live in Feb. 2020, and it continues to run alongside the Mainnet Beta version of Solana today.\n\nSolana launched on Mainnet Beta in Mar. 2020, shortly after raising $1.76 million in a public token auction hosted on CoinList. The project's beta network featured basic transaction capabilities and smart contract support. But it did not include any staking rewards as Solana was still determining its ongoing issuance schedule. The current plan is to upgrade from its current beta stage to a more production-ready version in either later 2020 or early 2021.\n\nAt the moment, Solana Labs remains a core contributor to the Solana network, while the Solana Foundation helps fund ongoing development and community building efforts.",

In return, stakers will receive inflation rewards. Solana has not enabled inflation rewards yet, but it intends to unlock inflation in late 2020 or early 2021.\nTransaction Fees: Users can use SOL to pay for fees for sending transactions or running smart contracts (interacting with applications)."

Additional participants included Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures. The firms received SOL tokens in exchange for their investments, although the number of tokens allocated to investors was not disclosed. Solana announced the new capital would be pushed toward engineering and project management. See more details here.\n\nIn 2020, Solana raised its fourth private sale (dubbed a Strategic Sale) and held a public auction sale hosted by CoinList, which brought in another ~$4 million combined. The remaining tokens from the initial SOL supply will go to Solana Labs team members, the Solana Foundation (to help fund development and balance validator voting power), and a \"community reserve\" (also managed by the Solana Foundation) to fund community initiatives and application developers.\n\nThe initial distribution of SOL tokens is as follows:\n15.86% to Seed Round investors\n2.63 to Founding Sale investors\n5.07% to Validator Sale investors\n1.84% to Strategic Sale investors\n1.6% to Public Auction Sale investors\n12.5% to team members\n12.5% to the Solana Foundation\n38% to the Community reserve fund (managed by the Solana Foundation)"

The tokens issued in these sales should become liquid around Jan. 7, 2021. The project's public auction sale (held in Mar. 2020) did not come with a lockup schedule, and the SOL tokens distributed in that sale (which totaled 1.6% of the initial supply) were fully liquid once the network launched.\n\nThe founder's allocation (12.5% of the initial supply) will also be subject to a nine-month lockup post-network launch. After the lockup period ends, these tokens will vest monthly for another two years (expected to fully vest by Jan. 2023).\n\nThe Grant Pool and Community Reserve (both overseen by the Solana Foundation) contain ~38% of the initial SOL supply combined. These allocations began to vest in small amounts since Solana's mainnet launch. One million Grant Pool tokens vested every three months for the first nine months, and 35 million Community Reserve tokens vested in 5 million token increments over the same timeframe. The entire allocations for these categories will unlock in Jan. 2021.\n\nThe Solana Foundation's allocation began vesting in small increments every month following the network's launch. The foundation also unlocked 11,365,067 SOL at launch to lend to a market maker for six months. After disclosing this information to SOL holders, the team opted to burn an equivalent amount of tokens from the foundation's allocation.\n\nOngoing Emissions\nSolana validators voted to enable <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/61adff26-b903-4ab9-8329-952d6a555228\">\"pico-inflation\"</a> on Dec. 24, 2020. The SOL supply is now inflating at an annual rate of 0.1%, with newly minted tokens going to validators and stakers in proportion to their staked amounts. This relatively low inflation rate is only temporary and will be replaced by a more substantial and permanent inflation proposal at some point in 2021.\n\nThis \"final\" inflation proposal includes an initial annual inflation rate of 8%. However, this inflation rate will decrease at an annual rate of 15% (\"dis-inflation rate\"). Solana's inflation rate will continue to decrease until it reaches an annual rate of 1.5%, which the network should reach in about ten years or 2031. 1.5% will remain the long-term inflation rate for Solana unless the network's governance system votes to change it.",

The current network setting has around 400 milliseconds (ms) for one slot. Every 400ms, the network has a potential rollback point, but every subsequent vote doubles the amount of time that the network would have to stall before it can unroll that vote. In short, secondary votes make it much harder to undo the transactions executed in a particular slot. Therefore, a block with several votes has a greater chance of remaining a part of the chain permanently.\n\nAs an example, each validator has voted 32 times in the last 12 seconds. The vote 12 seconds ago now will have a timeout of 2³² slots or roughly 54 years. Effectively, this vote will never be rolled back by the network. Whereas the most recent vote has a timeout of two slots or about 800ms. As new blocks are added to the ledger, old blocks are increasingly likely to be confirmed because the number of slots old votes is committed to doubles every slot. Tower BTF offers finality once two-thirds of network validators have voted on some order of events. Once transactions are finalized, they can't be rolled back.\n\nThe Solana mainnet is planned to operate in delegated-Proof-of-Stake (dPoS), in which token holders can participate in the block production process and earn rewards by either stake token and become a validator themselves, or delegate their tokens to validators they trust.\n\nAny individual can become a validator on the network and contribute to the overall security of the protocol. There is no minimum staking requirement, although the leader selection process (which validator gets to propose the next block) is stake-weighted. The network architecture is designed to scale with bandwidth and hardware, utilizing GPU cores to parallelize execution and reduce verification times. Due to the GPU requirement, hardware expectations are slightly higher than some protocols. Estimated costs for a satisfactory setup are around $5,000.",

                    "overview": {
                        "technology_details": "Solana’s highly performant blockchain is built using the eight innovations:\nProof of History: A clock before consensus\nTower BFT: A PoH-optimized version of PBFT\nTurbine: A block propagation protocol\nGulfstream: Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol\nSealevel: World’s first parallel smart contracts run-time\nPipelining: Transaction processing unit for validation\nCloudbreak: Horizontally-scaled accounts database\nArchivers: Distributed ledger storage\n\nProof of History: A clock before consensus\nThe biggest challenge in distributed networks is agreeing on the time and sequence in which events occurred as nodes within the network can’t trust the timestamp on messages received from other nodes. Solana attempts to solve this with Proof of History (PoH) by creating a cryptographically secure source of time across the network. Proof of History is a high-frequency Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), which requires a specific number of sequential steps to evaluate but produces a unique output that can be publicly verified. This means that nodes can create the next block without having to coordinate with the entire network first because they can trust the timestamp and ordering of the messages that they’ve received. The result is a reduction in consensus overhead.\n\nTower BFT: A PoH-optimized version of PBFT\nOn top of Proof of History, Solana runs its consensus mechanism called Tower BFT, which is a PBFT-like algorithm that leverages the synchronized clock enabled by PoH to achieve consensus on network transactions. At a high level, each time a node on the network votes on a particular fork, they commit to a certain amount of time where they are locked out from voting on an opposing fork. This period where they are locked out grows exponentially as they continue to vote on the same fork until they achieve a maximum lockout at 32 votes for the same fork. Nodes on the network will only receive inflation rewards when they reach this maximum vote lockout; therefore, it is in their interest to continue voting on the fork they believe the supermajority of the network is voting for.\n\nTurbine: A block propagation protocol\nSolana transmits blocks (communicates blocks between validators) independently of consensus, using a separate but connected protocol called Turbine. Turbine borrows heavily from BitTorrent and is optimized for streaming. As a block is streamed, it is broken up into small packets along with erasure codes, and then fanned out across a large set of random peers.\n\nGulf Stream: Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol\nIn a high-performance network, mempool management presents a new class of problems when it comes to the cost of filtering and maintaining a rising number of unconfirmed transactions. Gulf Stream functions by pushing transaction caching and forwarding to the edge of the network. Since every validator knows the order of upcoming leaders (block producers) in Solana architecture, clients and validators forward transactions to the expected leader ahead of time. This allows validators to execute transactions ahead of time, reduce confirmation times, switch leaders faster, and reduce the memory pressure on validators from the unconfirmed transaction pool. One consequence of knowing leaders ahead of time is an increased risk of validator collusion since the network allows more time for them to coordinate. Solana's fast block times might mitigate the opportunity for collusion because it limits the time allowed to plan an attack. \n\nSealevel: Parallel smart contracts run-time\nSolana built Sealevel, a hyper parallelized transaction processing engine designed to scale horizontally across GPUs and SSDs. Most other blockchains are single-threaded computers. In contrast, Solana can support parallel transaction execution (in addition to signature verification) in a single shard. The solution to this problem borrows heavily from an operating system driver technique called scatter-gather. Transactions specify upfront what state they will read and write while executing. Sealevel is able to find the non-overlapping transactions occurring in a block and execute them in parallel (called parallel execution) while optimizing how read and writes to the state are scheduled across an array of RAID 0 SSDs. Sealevel is a VM that schedules transactions, but it doesn’t actually execute transactions in the VM. Instead, Sealevel hands off transactions to be executed on hardware natively using bytecode called the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF).\n\nPipeline: A Transaction Processing Unit for validation optimization\nThe process of transaction validation on the Solana network makes extensive use of an optimization common in CPU design called pipelining. Pipelining is an appropriate process when there’s a stream of input data that needs to be processed by a sequence of steps and there’s different hardware responsible for each step. On the Solana network, the pipeline mechanism, the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), progresses through Data Fetching at the kernel level, Signature Verification at the GPU level, Banking at the CPU level, and Writing at the kernel space. By the time the TPU starts to send blocks out to the validators, it’s already fetched in the next set of packets, verified their signatures, and begun crediting tokens. The GPU parallelization in this four-stage pipeline allows the Solana TPU to operate at a high performance.\n\nCloudbreak: Horizontally-scaled accounts database\nMethods to scale computation using these other innovations could result in memory bottlenecks. Memory is used to keep track of accounts and can struggle to maintain performance due to a lack of memory size and limited access speeds. Cloudbreak was designed to optimize for concurrent reads and writes spread across a RAID 0 configuration of SSDs. Each additional disk adds storage capacity available to on-chain programs, while also increasing the number of concurrent reads and writes programs can perform when executing. This goes hand in hand with Solana’s transaction design, allowing for pre-fetching accounts from disk and preparing the runtime for execution, also enabling nodes on the network to begin executing transactions before they are encoded into a block. All of this aims to help reduces block times and confirmation latency on the network.\n\nArchivers: Distributed ledger storage\nStoring and maintaining data on a high-performance network is likely to become a primary centralization vector. If storage costs are very high, only well-funded entities will be able to act as validators and participate in consensus. On Solana, data storage is offloaded from validators to a network of nodes called Archivers. Archivers do not participate in consensus. The history of the state is broken into many pieces and erasure codes. Archivers store small parts of the state. Every so often, the network will ask the Archivers to prove that they’re storing the data they are supposed to. Solana leverages Proofs of Replication (PoRep), which are borrowed heavily from Filecoin. Archivers are not currently implemented and are on the long term roadmap. They will be rolled out based on network data demands.",

Cardano does not have a single published white paper but is developed from a collection of academic papers. Cardano sees itself as a “third-generation” protocol, improving on Bitcoin and Ethereum as the first and second generations, respectively. Cardano is named after an Italian Renaissance mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, and its native currency ADA is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician sometimes referenced as the first computer programmer. \n\nCardano is backed by three entities: IOHK, The Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo. IOHK is a blockchain research and development company founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood that is contracted to work on Cardano from 2015 through 2020. The Cardano Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on core development and ecosystem growth for Cardano. Emurgo is a Japanese venture capital firm. \n\nCardano's full launch will consist of five phases: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. The Byron era arrived in September 2017 with the mainnet launch of the Cardano blockchain. During this phase, the chain operated as a federated network that only supported ADA transactions. The next phase, Shelley, launched in July 2020, bringing Cardano's proposed Ouroboros Proas Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol to life. It's now in the process of rolling out its third phase, Goguen, which will add support for smart contracts and native token issuance. Cardano development teams, IOHK and Emurgo, are researching and building the network's remaining phases, Basho and Voltaire, in parallel with Goguen.",

The Byron chain ran on a purpose-built consensus layer, called Ouroboro Genesis, which operated as a federated network with the majority of the node managed by the Cardano Foundation. Therefore, any block rewards generated during this initial phase were burned (no inflation during Byron). \n\nThe Byron era also saw the delivery of the Daedalus wallet, IOHK's official desktop wallet for ADA, as well as Yoroi, a light wallet built by Emurgo for quick transactions and day-to-day use."

Cardano plans to release a Shelley mainnet candidate chain around Jun. 23 before releasing the code to mainnet on the Jun. 30 target date. The official hard fork that will activate Shelley’s changes could arrive on Jul. 29, which would give network participants enough time to upgrade their nodes and wallets. According to the roadmap, Cardano will begin paying out staking rewards around Aug. 18."

The goal is to improve the underlying performance of Cardano to better support growth and adoption for applications that require high transaction volumes.\n\nTwo of the primary developments proposed for the Bash era are sidechains and parallel accounting styles. Sidechains are new blockchains (like shard chains) that interoperate with the main chain. They can help off-load work from this base layer to increase the overall capacity of the network (scalability through parallel computation). While Cardano uses a UTXO model, sidechains will also have the ability to support account-based models. By having parallel accounting styles, Cardano might be able to interoperate with external networks more easily or support new kinds of uses cases."

Cardano’s modularization allows for network delegation, sidechains, and light client data structures.\n\nOuroboros design\nOuroboros consensus is determined by slot leaders who are elected by token holders with a sufficient stake in the network. Slot leaders operate in epochs to listen for and confirm transactions to produce blocks, which are then approved by input endorsers. A Cardano input endorser is the second set of stakeholders that verifies transactions included in blocks. Cardano believes this design is scalable since the network can increase the number of slots per epoch and run multiple epochs across the network simultaneously.",

The project was introduced on Twitter by Jackson Palmer on November 27, 2013 when he tweeted about \"investing\" on “Dogecoin”, a made-up name. Some of Palmer's friends encouraged him to create a real Dogecoin project, so he registered dogecoin.com and started working. Billy Markus saw the website and reached out to Palmer. Markus and Palmer thought Dogecoin would make the cryptocurrency space more palletable to newcomers since, as they built the protocol, Bitcoin was beleaguered by associations with Silk Road and dark web. Palmer exited the Dogecoin project and community in June 2014 by tweeting, \"Unsubshibing. Peace.\"\n\nUnlike a variety of other altcoins launched in 2013 and 2014, Dogecoin has proved itself surprisingly resilient to crypto-asset market cycles, which is speculated to be the result of meme durability.

New blocks are added to the chain every 60 seconds, on average. \n\nDogecoin uses scrypt hash function for its proof-of-work consensus mechanism. The scrypt algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale, custom-hardware attacks. At launch, Dogecoin was mine-able on personal computers, which was attractive to cryptocurrency enthusiasts during a time when Bitcoin mining was increasingly industrialized and capital intensive. \n\nDogecoin has no formal white paper, although several fans have written blog and forum posts as stand-in explainer documents.

                        "background_details": "Polkadot origins\nPolkadot is the brainchild of Dr. Gavin Wood, who is one of the co-founders of Ethereum and the inventor of the Solidity smart contract language. Dr. Wood started working on his idea to “design a sharded version of Ethereum” in mid-2016 and released the first draft of the Polkadot white paper in Oct. 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Wood and Parity’s Peter Czaban founded the Web3 Foundation, a non-profit entity established to support the research and development of Polkadot as well as to oversee its fundraising efforts. The Switzerland-based Web3 Foundation hosted Polkadot’s first token sale in Oct. 2017, using a Spend-All Second Price Dutch Auction to distribute the funds. The sale raised $145 million in just under two weeks, selling 50% of the initial 10 million DOT (old) supply, and the Web3 Foundation chose Parity Technologies to develop Polkadot.\n\nParity Technologies was founded by Dr. Wood and Jutta Steiner and is known for maintaining the Parity Ethereum client in addition to Substrate, which serves as the development framework for Polkadot.\n\nParity Wallet hack and subsequent fundraising efforts\nTen days after the token sale ended (Nov. 6, 2017), someone permanently froze the funds in the Parity multisig contract (the second such incident in a matter of months) compromising a little over $90 million worth of ETH equaling around 66% of Polkadot’s token sale proceeds. Polkadot, along with Parity, has petitioned the Ethereum community to consider finding a way to return to the funds, but the situation remains unresolved. Despite the lost funds, Polkadot and Web3 Foundation reported the project still had enough funds to meet its development milestones.\n\nThe Web3 Foundation reportedly raised more capital to replenish the lost funds in a 2019 private token sale. In the sale, Polkadot sought to sell 500,000 DOT (old) tokens at a $1.2 billion valuation, pricing the tokens at $120 apiece. Although the foundation did not disclose any details related to the raise, it was reported that the sale closed in June 2019 at a “successful” valuation.\n\nPolkadot technical developments and mainnet rollout\nOn the technical front, Polkadot started rolling out various proofs-of-concept (PoCs) in May 2018 to test its base relay chain, the relay chain’s support for parachains, and its finality agent (dubbed GRANDPA). PoC 3, released in Jan. 2019, also introduced the Alexander testnet, Polkadot’s first test network. But the project’s first significant release came in Aug. 2019 with the public launch of Kusama. Kusama is an early, unaudited, and unrefined release of Polkadot, designed to serve as a \"canary\" network for Polkadot to test governance, staking, and sharding under real economic conditions. Polkadot also dedicated 1% of the initial DOT supply to Kusama stakeholders in order to encourage participation.\n\nPolkadot adopted a staged rollout strategy for its mainnet launch. Polkadot's first mainnet chain candidate, Phase 1, launched on <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/polkadot-goes-live-with-the-release-of-its-first-mainnet-chain-candidate\">May 27, 2020</a>. It marked the initial step in a multi-stage rollout process detailed in the project's mainnet launch roadmap. This early version of Polkadot operated as Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network managed by six validators belonging to the Web3 Foundation. Eventually, the network transitioned to its proposed Nominated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system on Jun. 18, 2020 (Phase 2), which enabled DOT owners to claim validators slots and unlocked staking rewards. Phases 3 and 4 in late Jul. 2020 introduced Polkadot's governance functionality and handing control of the protocol over to the community, respectively. The final phase plans to unlock DOT token transfers on Aug. 18, 2020.\n\nThe Web3 Foundation continues to use the proceeds from DOT sales to fund ecosystem initiatives and back projects building on Polkadot (see: the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/polychain-web3-foundation-start-a-fund-to-back-projects-building-on-polkadot\">Polkadot Ecosystem Fund</a>). The foundation is governed by the Foundation Council, a governing body consisting of Dr. Gavin Wood (President and Founder), Dr. Aeron Buchanan (Vice President), and Reto Trinkler.\n\nDOT redenomination\nIn the first official community vote for the network, Polkadot token holders voted to change the denomination between DOT and its smallest unit, Plancks, by a factor of 100. This change officially went into effect at block #1,248,328, which arrived on Aug. 21, 2020, about 72 hours after DOT transfers unlocked at block #1,205,128  (Aug. 18, 2020).\n\nIt was a cosmetic change that was similar to a stock split. The token balances of each Polkadot account increased by 100x, increasing the total DOT supply from its original 10 million to 1 billion. But the move did not impact Polkadot’s pre-market valuation as the dollar amount of each DOT will decrease by 100x.",

It marked the initial step in a multi-stage rollout process detailed in the project's mainnet launch roadmap. This early version of Polkadot operates as Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network managed by six validators belonging to the Web3 Foundation. It also allows DOT investors to claims their tokens and submit their intention to act as a validator or nominator within the network's future Nominated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) design. Future launch stages will gradually introduce staking-based consensus and Polkadot's proposed on-chain governance system to lessen the influence Web3 has over the network.\n\nLearn more:\nW3F Initiates Launch: Polkadot is Live\nPolkadot CC1 Genesis: What to expect"

More importantly, it allows DOT token sale purchasers to start staking their tokens with elected validators in exchange for a portion of inflation reward payouts.\n\nEventually, Polkadot will start progressively increasing the validator set, reaching as high as 1,000 validators possibly by November."

This move gave the newly elected 13-member Council and DOT token holders the ability to propose and vote on protocol improvements or changes. Polkadot also has a three-member Technical Committee, with two seats held by the Parity and another one managed by the Web3 Foundation. Technical Committee members can carry out protocol changes quickly should a network issue arise.

With the removal of these admin keys, Polkadot has now transitioned from a candidate chain to its official mainnet and no longer operates similarly to a permissioned network.\n\nThe network's future direction is now in the hands of its on-chain governance system, a three-chamber model consisting of a Council, a Technical Committee, and DOT token holders. The Web3 Foundation also said, \"one of the first post-Sudo upgrades will likely enable balance transfers in the network.\""

When messages are sent between two blockchains on the network, DOT's are used to pay for fees. DOT holders are also responsible for managing significant events by voting on protocol upgrades and fixes. The token also ensures that network participants act in a manner that does not damage the network by giving them skin in the game. In order to create new parachains, tokens must be bonded ensuring incentive alignment.\n\nHow to stake DOTs\nWhile validators on Polkadot need to maintain the (often expensive) hardware necessary to secure the network, anyone can assume the role of a nominator by bonding their DOTs to a dedicated validator. Bonding tokens helps increase the network’s cost of attack and allows DOT holders to earn newly minted tokens as staking rewards. Polkadot is targeting about a 75% stake rate, which at a 10% inflation rate in the network’s inaugural year, would provide an annual staking return of~20%. Bonded tokens will remain locked for twelve weeks and are subject to slashing (loss of funds) should the chosen validator go offline or misbehave.\n\nPolkadot Wallet\nThere are multiple teams working on Polkadot wallet implementations prior to network launch. Most notably, blockchain.com announced that it will integrate DOT tokens into its wallet allowing users to store, send and receive tokens as well as participate in governance by voting on proposals."

The sale was split between a private sale, which raised over $80 million, and a public sale, which raised the remainder. Participants were required to use a KYC system called PICOPS, which verifies the identity of each participant. Participants that were unable to verify themselves were deemed ineligible. The sale was also not available to any Chinese or American citizens due to regulatory concerns. \n\nAt the start of the network, a total of 10 million DOT (old) will be created as a native token. The initial supply was later redenominated by a community vote, a cosmetic change that increased token account balances by 100x. The following allocations are the same for both DOT (old) and new DOT:\n\n50% allocated to token sale investors\n5% allocated to the 2019 private sale investors\n3.4% allocated to 2020 token sale investors\n11.6% retained by the Foundation for future fundraising efforts\n30% allocated to the Web 3 Foundation for immediate use to develop the Polkadot network and other undisclosed Foundation activities.\n\nThe total supply is not fixed at 1 billion but instead will use a to be determined inflationary model to supply the rewards for the proof-of-stake (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\">PoS</a>) system. \n\nOn Nov. 6, 2017, a vulnerability was exploited in the Parity multi-sig wallet containing over 500,000 ETH, including $98 million of the $140 million+ in ETH raised through the Polkadot ICO. These funds are currently frozen, and a debate among the Ethereum community will determine whether these funds can or will ever be recovered. Even if the funds are lost, the Parity team does not believe this will impact their development roadmap.\n\nIn Jun. 2019, The Web3 Foundation announced it sold another 500,000 DOT (old) tokens (now 50 million new DOT) to an undisclosed group of private investors. Based on previous reports from Polkadot, the project was seeking to raise $60 million at a $1.2 billion valuation through this token sale. The Jun. 2019 announcement declared the raise successful, implying the Polkadot reached its target."

Considering the DOT (old) initial supply of 10 million, Polkadot hoped to set the price for each token at $120, a substantial increase from the sub-$30 price tag for DOTs in Polkadot's 2017 ICO.\n\nReports covering this tokens sale depict a convolution process. In particular, CoinDesk relayed in June that the raise [hit a snag](https://www.coindesk.com/1-billion-valuation-may-elude-ethereum-co-founders-new-blockchain-polkadot) when three Chinese funds agreed to purchase $15 million worth of DOTs but only at a discount.

                            "consensus_details": "Polkadot uses what it calls a hybrid consensus, which separates finality from the block production mechanism. At a high level, Polkadot allows the network to produce blocks at a rapid pace while permitting the slower finality agent to run in a separate process, thereby not affecting transaction execution times. This design theoretically helps overcome the issues associated with probabilistic finality, namely the chance of unknowingly following an incorrect fork or the inability to produce new blocks (aka stalling).\n\nThe two mechanisms that power Polkadot’s consensus include:\nBABE: The Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) is the block production mechanism. It assigns block production slots to randomly selected validators according to stake (as defined by the Polkadot randomness cycle).\nGRANDPA: The GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement (GRANDPA) is the finality gadget for the Polkadot relay chain. This agent reaches agreements on chains rather than blocks, which could speed up the finalization process. Polkadot helps elaborate on this definition by stating if “more than 2/3 of validators attest to a chain containing a certain block, all blocks leading up to that one are finalized at once.”\n\nWhile the core technology of Polkadot is the relay chain, the network reaches consensus through a modified and proprietary PoS mechanism consisting of four key participants: collators, validators, nominators, and fishermen.\n\nCollator\nEach parachain has a collator that fulfills the task of a miner in a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-work\">proof-of-work</a> (PoW) blockchain. A collator must maintain the Polkadot relay chain state as well as the state of the parachain. The collator then manages the queue of transactions going into and out of the parachain from the relay chain. Collators collect parachain transactions, produce state transition proofs, create new candidate blocks and then pass them along to validators in exchange for a fee for their work. In a competitive market with many collators, collators can incentivize validators to choose their block by sharing a portion of their fee with the validator.\n\nValidators\nValidators are randomly nominated to accept block candidates from parachain collators, verify the information in the block, and republish the block candidate to the Polkadot relay chain. Once a validator confirms a block, they also validate and change the state of the relay chain block by moving the transaction data from the originating parachain’s input queue to the destination parachain’s output queue. Validators are incentivized through a staking mechanism that requires them to stake Polkadot (DOT) tokens to the network to be chosen as an active validator. Validators that break the consensus algorithm are punished by losing a portion of their stake, while those that correctly secure the network and verify blocks are rewarded with new tokens.\n\nNominators\nNominators are those who may be unable to participate in the transaction validation process directly, so they instead contribute tokens to a validator of their choice. Nominators receive a pro-rata share of the validator reward based on their portion of the validator’s bond, so nominators are incentivized to choose a validator most likely to receive the largest reward. The team believes the nominator process will create a competitive, but honest, marketplace for high-quality validators and nominators.\n\nFishermen\nFishermen do not participate in the transaction validation process with validators and nominators, but instead, act as watchmen monitoring activity across the Polkadot network and identify validators who break consensus rules. Fishermen stake a smaller bond of tokens than a validator but receive a proportionally larger reward than validators for their role in securing the network.",

                        "technology_details": "Polkadot features a variety of technical components, including the relay-chain, parachains, the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE), and cross-network bridges.\n\nRelay-chain\nPolkadot's relay-chain is built with Substrate, a blockchain building framework that is the distillation of Parity technologies learnings building Ethereum, Bitcoin, and enterprise blockchains. It is at the core of the network, helping map addresses to account information, coordinating communications, and providing consensus through a pooled security mechanism utilizing proof-of-stake (PoS). All validators stake their DOTs and produced blocks directly on the relay-chain.\n\nThe relay chain lacks features like smart contracts and instead is designed to be a minimal protocol to connect other network participants and provide transaction finality. Since this central chain is handling the bulk of the network’s transaction flows, actions on the relay-chain may come at a premium. But the relay-chain will delegate a significant portion of the computational work to the surrounding parachains, which can have “differing implementations and features.”\n\nParachains\nParachains will be used to collect and process transactions while using the relay chain for finality. To increase transaction throughput, parachains will process transactions concurrently across multiple chains, instead of queuing transactions and processing them sequentially.\n\nPolkadot does not place any constraints on the design and structure of parachains. These network components can be application-specific or support a particular feature (e.g., privacy or scalability). But each parachain must generate a proof regularly so a designated Polkadot validator can verify and reconcile past transactions. Parachains also share the same state as the relay-chain, meaning if the relay-chain should revert at any point, then all parachains would revert as well. In terms of composability, cross-parachain communication is native to Polkadot. Therefore, parachains will be able to send messages (including transactions and data) to each other “without the need for smart contracts to perform the bridging functionality.”\n\nPolkadot Runtime Environment (PRE)\nThe PRE consists of the networking, consensus and WebAssembly Virtual Machine subsystems. Polkadot breaks the components of the PRE down to:\nNetwork Interactions\nState storage and the Storage Trie\nConsensus Engine\nWasm Virtual Machine (VM)\n\nPolkadot’s state machine is compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), a high-performance virtual environment. WASM is developed by major companies including Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla, that have created a large ecosystem of support for the standard. Polkadot's networking uses libp2p, a cross-platform network framework for peer-to-peer applications that handles the peer discovery and communication in the Polkadot ecosystem. The Polkadot runtime environment is being coded in C++, and Golang to make Polkadot accessible to a wider range of developers.\n\nBridging\nPolkadot will eventually enable the connections to outside networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin through a series of specialized bridge contracts or modules. There are two different types of external bridging in Polkadot:\nBridge contracts: Smart contracts that connect Polkadot’s relay-chain to external chains (for example, the Parity Bridge between an Ethereum Proof-of-Authority (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-authority\">PoA</a>) sidechain to a Substrate-based chain)\nIn-built bridging modules: Purpose-built modules that help external chains connect with Polkadot",

This governance system remained intact through Polkadot's mainnet launch and early existence. In late Jul. 2020, control over the protocol was transferred to the network's proposed on-chain governance system, which takes into consideration token holders, validators, a Council, and a Technical Committee. These network participants are now the primary source of upgrade submissions and approvals. Parity and Web3 can still develop and submit proposals of their own, but they must pass through the governance system before being implemented.",

                        "onchain_governance_details": "Polkadot’s future on-chain governance system that hands the future direction of the protocol over to a technical council, an on-chain entity consisting of members voted in by network stakeholders. This system will allow active token holders and Council members to propose codebase changes by bonding a minimum amount of DOTs to the network to ensure some economic buy-in. Other token holders can also deposit an equivalent amount of tokens to the proposal to support it. The top proposals by stake amount are selected to be a referendum, which Polkadot defines as “inclusive, stake-based voting schemes.” Bonded tokens are returned once the proposal is brought to a vote. If the proposal originates within the Council, Council members can approve the raw submission internally and move the proposal to a referendum.\n\nEvery 30 days, a new referendum is brought to a vote, with separate queues for Council and public submissions. To vote, token holders must lock up their tokens “for at least the enactment delay period,” which could stretch beyond the end of the referendum, to ensure economic buy-in and discourage vote selling.\n\nWhat determines if the proposal passes the vote depends on which entity proposed the referendum. Polkadot references [three possible scenarios](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#tallying):\n- If a public submission, Positive Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Approve)\n- If a Council submission that reaches a “Complete agreement,” Negative Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Against)\n- If a Council submission that reaches a “Majority agreement,” Simple Majority\n\nAt genesis, the [Council](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#council) began with thirteen members, represented as on-chain accounts. There are plans to increase this total over the following nine months to a max of 24. DOT holders vote these representatives into their privileged positions via a network-wide election process. All members have a fixed term of one year, although any representative can be removed early via a referendum. Network participants rely on the Council for two primary tasks: proposing new referenda and canceling possibly malicious proposals. Members must reach a unanimous agreement to carry out a referendum cancellation.\n\nPolkadot also employs a [Technical Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#technical-committee), first introduced in the Kusama rollout, as one of the three chambers of its governance system. Committee representatives consist of teams that previously “implemented or specified either Polkadot/Kusama runtime or the runtime environment.” The Council has the power to either add or remove Technical Committee teams by a simple majority vote. The committee’s sole purpose is to produce emergency referenda in the event of a dire situation. These proposals get fast-tracked for Council voting and implementation.\n\nThis governance design is in practice at the moment on the Kusama network. Its upgrade to CC3 on Nov. 28, 2019, unlocked its on-chain governance capabilities, enabling stakeholders to submit and vote on potential code changes. Through this process, Kusama participants already increased the network validator count beyond its base level and unlocked KSM token transfers.\n\nSee Kusama referenda [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/democracy) and the list of Kusama Council members [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/council).",

In 2018, the project purchased file sharing service BitTorrent in order to expand its product. Tron is a long-term project with a set of 6 phases. \n\nExodus: building the free platform for peer to peer distribution, storage, and content. Exodus’ goal is to provide a simple distributed file sharing built on something similar to IPFS. \nOdyssey: introducing financial incentives to encourage content creation. Odyssey is supposed to incentivize early adopters and foster the growth of a community consisting of content creators and consumers. Reimbursement for creation will be through a tipping scheme, instead of views and clicks - as those methods can be easily exploited through bots.\nGreat Voyage: launching TRON-native ICO capability. Tron looks to allow content creators to offer a stake in a potential personal brand through individual ICOs or branded tokens. \nApollo: enable content producers to issue personal tokens\nStar Trek: brings a decentralized gaming and forecasting platform.\nEternity: aim for further decentralization of the gaming industry. This phase aims to bring the ability to fund-raise and monetize based on community growth. \n\nEventually, Tron’s core technology will be based on the adaptation of IPFS and Ethereum’s platform. In short, what Tron is trying to create is a huge mixture of what is already being done by other projects. Relatedly, Tron is criticized for plagiarism regarding its white paper. Founder Justin Sun tweeted that the translation was done by volunteers and excused it as carelessness on the part of translators.\n",

As a result, the approximated daily inflation is 1.38 million TRX and the approximated yearly inflation is over 500 million TRX.\n\nThe Foundation initially stated that it will pay the node and block producer rewards until January 1, 2021. As such, the foundation declared that there will be no inflation on the TRON network before January 1, 2021, and the TRON Foundation will award all block rewards and candidate rewards prior to that date. Nevertheless, since the current rewards are not coming from the Foundation as of today, it is unclear if the 1 billion TRX burnt on June 25, 2018, were meant to pay for these rewards, or if the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/tron-foundation\">Tron Foundation</a> will conduct other burns. Given the current rewards structure, the Foundation would need to burn an additional 250 million TRX to pay for block rewards until January 1, 2021.\n\nEvery 24 hours, the network grants every account a free pool of bandwidth that allows users to execute free transactions. In order to realize more transactions, users may freeze TRX to get additional bandwidth or decide to pay the fees in TRX. The fees paid directly in TRX are burned by the network.",

A total of 27 \"super representatives\" are responsible for validating blocks on the network. Super representatives are chosen through a voting system that allows users to vote based on the tokens that they hold.\n\nTron’s chain has a 3-tiered architecture: the storage layer, core layer, and application layer. The storage layer adopts a distributed protocol branched into block storage and state storage. Its underlying storage layer uses the graph database to manage data storage, which aims to manage data storage as Tron not only stores the node data but also inter-node connections. Its middle layer is composed of modules of smart contracts, account management, consensus and more. \n\nTronix (TRX) is the official name for the native Tron token. Miners earn TRX by providing data storage space to network users. Tron intends to be used as market model rather than a cloud model. Tron expects TRX tokens to act as a mediator between consumers and content creators without the need for token exchanges. It was initially an ERC20 token. On June 24th, 2018, Tron migrated from Ethereum protocol to TRON MainNet in a one-to-one swap. \n",

The research was led by Emin Gün Sirer, a professor of computer science and software engineer, assisted by doctoral students Maofan \"Ted\" Yin and Kevin Sekniqi. Following the research stage, Ava Labs was founded to develop the network primarily to meet complex financial industry requirements. In March 2020, the AVA codebase for the Avalanche consensus protocol became open-source and available to the public.   \n\nIn addition to meeting complex financial industry requirements, Avalanche targets three broad use cases:\n\n– Building application-specific blockchains, spanning permissioned (private) and permissionless (public) deployments.\n– Building and launching highly scalable and decentralized applications (Dapps).\n– Building arbitrarily complex digital assets with custom rules, covenants, and riders (smart assets).\n\nAvalanche's Initial Coin Offering ended on July 15, 2020, followed by the launch of mainnet in September of the same year. In September 2020, the protocol also issued the native token AVAX (an acronym for \"Avalanche\"). Ultimately, Avalanche is designed to be a high-performing, scalable, customizable, and secure blockchain platform.",

                            "consensus_details": "Avalanche utilizes a DAG-optimized novel family of Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols collectively called Snow. The family consists of three components – Slush, Snowflake, and Snowball. Snowflake and Snowball are leaderless Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols built around Slush, a non-BFT metastable mechanism. Inspired by gossip algorithms, consensus gains its properties through the metastable mechanism whereby the system operates by repeatedly sampling the network at random and steering correct nodes towards a common outcome. \n\nThe metastable mechanism aims to quickly move a large network to an irreversible state, where the irreversibility implies that a sufficiently large portion of the network has accepted a proposal, and a conflicting proposal will not be accepted with any higher than negligible probability. \n\nIn simple terms, Avalanche's consensus is leaderless by design. Transactions are verified by having nodes communicate with each other at random until a sufficiently large portion of them reach an agreement. A validator's chance of being sampled is proportional to their AVAX stake. A validator will receive a staking reward if they are online and respond for more than 80% of their validation period, as measured by a majority of validators. The minimum amount that a validator must stake is 2,000 AVAX. Avalanche's leaderless design allows it to waive slashing penalties, which can otherwise act as a deterrent to prospective stakers. Ultimately, this approach is aimed at maximizing its total validator set.\n\nFurther, because Avalanche is a lightweight protocol, the minimum computer requirements are quite modest and do not require special computer hardware.\n\n· Hardware: 8 core CPU   = 2 GHz, RAM: 16 GB, Storage: 200 GB free space.\n· OS: Ubuntu   = 18.04 or Mac OS X   = Catalina. (Ubuntu versions older than 18.04 may work but have not been tested.)\n· Network: IPv4 or IPv6 network connection, with an open public port, capable of at least 30Mbps throughput.\n\nRequirements scale with the amount of AVAX staked on the node. A large node (100k+ AVAX staked) gets the most significant instance to ensure the node doesn't fall behind and jeopardize staking rewards. A small node (less than 10k AVAX staked) can run a healthy node on a below-spec computer.",

Avalanche uses Proof-of-Stake, allowing validators to have a first-hand say in the system while consuming minimal energy. Avalanche is not a single chain network. It features multiple chains, with some performing core functions while others are more application-specific. All non-core Avalanche chains (called subnets) must rely on validators that stake AVAX on one of Avalanche’s central platforms. Validators must be a member of the Primary Network; all other subnets are optional. The Primary Network contains three blockchains: \n\nPlatform Chain (P-Chain) \nContract Chain (C-Chain) \nExchange Chain (X-Chain) \n\nAll three combine to provide the same capabilities of a single network. The X-Chain handles the creation of new digital assets and the exchange of tokens between the core blockchains and their various subnets. The C-Chain is an instance of Ethereum’s EVM, which allows for the creation and execution of Solidity-based applications. The last chain, known as the P-Chain, is the base staking platform that manages network validators and enables developers to create new subnets. Every validator must stake on the P-Chain and participate in securing Avalanche’s Primary Network.",

Parameters include factors such as the minimum staking amount and minting rate. This enables the platform to effectively perform dynamic parameter optimization through a crowd oracle. Avalanche does not allow unlimited changes to arbitrary aspects of the system. Instead, only a pre-determined number of parameters can be modified via governance, rendering the system more predictable and increasing safety. Further, all governable parameters are subject to limits within specific time bounds, ensuring that the system remains predictable over short time ranges.",

The project will work with the Grant Ambassador to establish milestones for the project, which will be used to assess the project's progress. All projects must be open-source (published with an open-source software license) and available on GitHub. Please invite the Grant Ambassador to the repo if a private repo is preferred.

To alleviate the cash shortfall, BitFinex announced it would conduct a private offering for $1 billion for it's token Unus Sed Leo. \n\nThe token will be used to receive discounts on trading on current and future iFinex trading platforms and services. iFinex will buy back tokens from the market with a minimum of 27% of consolidated revenues from the previous month until all tokens are removed from circulation.

MCO tokens held by Crypto.com will not be eligible for the CRO airdrop. and all unallocated CRO airdrop tokens will be used for Community development activities. 20% will be allocated to Ecosystem grants and 20% will go to a Capital Reserve.\n\nCrypto.com Chain will utilize Tendermint Core as its consensus engine. The entirety of the supply has already been issued, but 50% has been set apart to incentivize  all actors providing services to ensure integrity and successful processing of the transactions. Indeed, 30% will be reserved for Secondary Distribution. The Secondary Distribution wallet will receive a daily token supply through  a smart contract.  10% will be issued the first year, 8% the second year, 6% the third year, 4% the fourth year and 2% the fifth year. Those tokens will be distributed as network fee incentives and progressively distributed on exchanges at prevailling market price. The rewards will be distributed to the following actors: Customer acquirer nodes (60%), Merchant acquirer nodes (20%) & Council Nodes (20%). Those actors will have to stake CRO in order to receive rewards. Moreover, 20% has been set aside for the Network long-term incentives.",

It was co-founded by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun to tackle blockchain scaling and usability issues. Traditional blockchains face high latency and transaction costs that can hamper their progress towards adoption, technological efficiency, and user experience. Layer-2 scaling solutions or external networks can act as load balances for networks that can't inherently scale as user activity increases.\n\nIn 2017, Plasma was at the forefront of blockchain scaling, and Matic featured a plasma-driven scaling approach and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) sidechains to assist Ethereum as user demand for the network grew. Over time, Matic POS became a prominent scaling option for various applications.\n\nMatic rebranded to Polygon in February 2021 to become a Swiss Army knife for scaling solutions. Polygon plans to add support for rollups and Validium to its already-existing Plasma/POS chain. The project recognizes that Ethereum may not scale from a single solution in isolation. There's a possibility that several solutions will co-exist and help scale Ethereum collectively, and Polygon aims to play a central role in supplying the infrastructure necessary to launch any of these systems.",

Computational resources are required for performing various functions on the Polygon Network, such as validating blocks and publishing proofs.

Matic's commit chains also feature slashing (removal of staked funds) to dissuade stakers from submitting invalid blocks, illegally verifying blocks, or executing invalid transactions. Requiring validators to put funds at risk before they can participate in consensus helps maintain the integrity of the network.\n\nMatic's existing PoS chain consists of two layers:\nThe Bor (Block Producer Layer): Responsible for aggregating transactions into blocks\nHeimdall layer (Validator Layer): Supports all validator nodes (stakers) that work alongside Matic's Staking contracts on Ethereum to manage validator accounts, enforce slashing, and issue rewards. Heimdall has been implemented by building on top of the Tendermint consensus engine with changes to the signature scheme and various data structures. It is responsible for block validation, block producer committee selection, and checkpointing a representation of the sidechain blocks to Ethereum in our architecture. Heimdall handles the aggregation of blocks produced by Bor into a Merkle tree and publishes the Merkle root to the root chain periodically.",

It publishes the Merkle root to the root chain periodically.\nBor (Block producer layer): Bor is Matic’s block producer layer - the entity responsible for aggregating transactions into blocks. It is an implementation of Geth with custom changes done to the consensus algorithm.\n\nPolygon SDK\nPolygon pivoted in February 2021 towards building a solution to connect the different versions of Ethereum scaling solutions. At the core of this Layer-2 connective tissue is the Polygon SDK (software development kit), which will serve as a modular, flexible framework for launching a new chain based on any Ethereuem scaling technology. Developers will have the option to build or connect true Layer-2 platforms like Plasma, Optimistic Rollups, zkRollups, and Validium enabled chains and standalone sidechains like Polygon's flagship product, Matic POS (Proof-of-Stake). The Polygon SDK is still in development.",
