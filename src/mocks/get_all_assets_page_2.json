Litecoin aimed to keep the best aspects of Bitcoin while making some optimizations for its use as a medium of exchange.\n\nNotably, Litecoin implements 2.5 minute block times and an 84 million max supply. Charlie Lee's original thinking was that quicker block confirmations would increase transaction throughput and reduce the amount of time merchants would need for block confirmations. Additionally, he thought the 84 million max supply would prevent the coin from becoming too scarce and expensive. Litecoin uses Scrypt, a memory intensive hashing algorithm, in order to better allow individuals to mine Litecoin with commodity hardware (although <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\">ASICs</a> have been developed for Litecoin mining over the past few years). Finally, Charlie Lee, recognizing the mistakes of the few altcoins launched prior to Litecoin, wanted Litecoin to be launched in a fair manner, electing to only do a 150 coin (3 block) premine to allow people to get in early.\n\nCharlie Lee left Coinbase in June 2017 to head the <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/litecoin-foundation\">Litecoin foundation</a>, which stewards the Litecoin project, and finances Litecoin Core development.

Bitcoin's parameters were changed in order to achieve this, with the result that eventual supply will top out at no more than 84 million coins.\n\nOn average, Litecoin generates new blocks every 2.5 minutes, rewarding miners with 12.5 new LTC and the total transaction fees from the preceding block. Each block has a 1MB limit and block rewards are <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/halving\">halved </a>every 840,000 blocks (approximately 4 years). Litecoin's first halvings occurred on August 2015 and  August 2019. The next halving will occur in August 2023.\n\nEventually, once the 84 million LTC hard cap has been reached, block rewards will transition entirely to transaction fees shifting the security model of the protocol to one based on demand for block space versus one based on demand for LTC. Similar to bitcoin, litecoin's supply dynamics are known with great precision, and the vast majority of all eventual coins will be minted in the first two decades.",

Consensus in Litecoin, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work, that would invalidate the current chain.\n\nMining\n\nMiners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using a Scypt algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hash-function\">hash</a> less than the target number set by Litecoin's <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. Similar to Bitcoin, the target difficulty level is adjusted every 2016 blocks; however, due to Litecoin's 2.5 minute block times, Litecoin's difficulty level adjusts more quickly than Bitcoin's.\n\nLitecoin originally implemented the Scrypt algorithm for its memory intensive properties, which made it more resistant to <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\">ASICs</a>; however, over time Litecoin's ASIC resistant properties have eroded with Scrypt-capable ASICs having been developed. Furthermore, in order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hash-power\">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.",

A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (<a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/mempool\">mempool</a>) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/double-spending\">double-spend</a> vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hash-function\">hash</a> less than the target number set by Litecoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Litecoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain.

It is backed by Alameda Research, a trading firm accounting for between $600 million and $1 billion of volume a day or roughly 5% of global volume. \n\nFTX was designed to prevent clawbacks using a three-tiered liquidation model that closes positions with rate-limited orders and leverages an insurance fund to prevent customer losses. Rather than fracturing liquidity across various tokens, collateral is shared in one universal stablecoin wallet to mimic the traditional futures market. FTX also allows traders to take leveraged or short positions without trading on margin or futures with their Leveraged Tokens that mimic the experience of trading on spot markets but allow 3x, -1x or -3x on various tokens. The FTX OTC desk is powered by Alameda and trades around $30 million per day with no fees. ",

NEAR has also been designed to be developer and user-friendly as it features a few key innovations to accelerate the application development and user-onboarding processes. The NEAR blockchain was created and developed by the NEAR Foundation. Its mainnet went live in April 2020, and network validators voted to unlock token transfers in October 2020.

Illia Polosukhin and Alexander Skidanov started NEAR.ai in early 2017 to explore program synthesis: the field of automating programs from a human specification. Named for the science fiction novel The Singularity Is Near, the NEAR project drew from Illia’s work as a lead contributor for TensorFlow at Google and Alexander’s as the lead engineer at MemSQL. \n\nResearching program synthesis led the team to explore programmable smart contract platforms and crypto payments in late 2017 and early 2018. As they explored the solution space and tried out a variety of blockchain protocols, they realized the current state of the tech didn’t meet their needs and began to design a blockchain that could. Illia and Alex gathered a team of engineers and formally started building NEAR Protocol in August 2018.  The founding vision for the NEAR platform was to offer developers an easy path to building decentralized applications that can scale to mass usage. To achieve these goals, NEAR adopted a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to support transaction verification and block production. \n\nNEAR combines a horizontal scaling approach with a new consensus mechanism that splits the network into parallel shards and dynamically distributes the computation to increase the network's processing capacity. The network launched in April 2020, became community-operated in September 2020, and passed a vote to enable token transfers in October 2020.",

The network charges transaction fees for processing the changes to this stored data. The NEAR network collects and automatically burns these fees, such that higher usage will lead to more NEAR tokens being burned. A minimum percentage of smart contract usage fees is allocated for developer rewards. This reward effectively incentivizes early application development that increase network use.

However, since transmitting a logical block across the network would be prohibitively expensive, it is never initiated. Instead, each network participant maintains the state that corresponds to the shards that they validate transactions for and any additional shard that they want to track. \n\nThe consensus is based on the heaviest chain consensus. Meaning, once a block producer publishes a block, they collect the signatures of validator nodes. The weight of a block is then the cumulative stake of all the signers whose signatures are included in the block. The weight of a chain is the sum of the block weights. Additionally, the consensus utilises a finality gadget that introduces additional slashing conditions for higher chain security. \n\nResources:\nNightshade Whitepaper\nHow to run a node",

                        "technology_details": "  NEAR’s blockchain uses a new consensus algorithm and a sharding architecture to achieve a relatively high level of performance. The key elements of NEAR’s technology are:\nDynamic Re-Sharding\nNightshade\nDoomslug\nFees as Developer Rewards\nToken Balance-Based Storage\n\nDynamic Re-Sharding\nThere are two ways to approach scalability - Horizontal and Vertical. NEAR has chosen to use sharding, which is a type of horizontal scaling technique. Sharding is an approach to scaling databases, and it involves spreading computing and storage capacity across multiple servers. In the world of blockchains, sharding involves partitioning a blockchain across subgroups of nodes and distributes computation across multiple parallelized sub-chains (\"shards\"). Sharding is not live on NEAR at the moment.\n\nOnce sharding goes live on NEAR, the network intends to regularly adjust the number of shards supported by the network based on user demand. The project calls this demand-based approach to scaling \"Dynamic re-sharding.\" This scheme allows the network to only pay for the infrastructure and scale it needs at any given time. Dynamic re-sharding might be a more cost-efficient approach to scaling and securing a sharded network since node storage requirements can adjust with demand.\n\nNightshade\nNEAR uses a new sharding approach called Nightshade to reach consensus and settle cross-shard transactions. Most sharded networks use a smaller validator committee that rotates its lead block proposer when validating transactions across shards. This approach introduces some difficulties to the validation process. For instance, these validator groups must either download the entire state of each shard or receive only the portion that changed. The validation process for either technique can be inefficient as the first one requires a bigger time frame and the second one requires a larger state size.\n\nNightshade offers a different model by modifying the typical sharding abstraction. It assumes that each shard works together to produce \"chunks\" of data that collectively create a single block. Blocks are produced with a regular cadence regardless of whether each individual shard has produced its “chunk” for that specific block height. Nightshade is a leader-based system, meaning it assigns a single validator to produce each block. This validator must assemble the data chunks generated by each shard during their leadership period into a block. Leadership assignments will rotate through the existing validator set. Validators don't accept transactions, only chunks.\n\nDoomslug\nDoomslug is NEAR Protocol's new block production technique. According to the team, it enables the network to achieve some sense of practical finality after one round of communication, with a finality gadget providing BFT finality after a secondround.  Practical finality in Doomslug (or Doomslug finality) is when a block is irreversible unless at least one participant is slashed. Doomslug also allows the network to continue producing and finalizing blocks as long as over half of the validator set are online and honest, although the finality gadget will stall if less than two-thirds of participants are online.\n\nFees as Developer Rewards\nNEAR distributes 30% of any transaction fee to the contract (or contracts) that transaction calls. The contract’s owner (often a developer group or a DAO) can decide how to allocate these funds. These fee “rewards'' effectively incentivize early application development on NEAR. The percentage of fees allocated to this reward is a system-level parameter (can be adjusted by governance), but developers may choose to receive any amount equal to or above this minimum value.\n\nToken-Based Storage\nNEAR token holders have the right to store data on the chain. For example, if someone holds a balance of 1 NEAR, it means that the person can store nearly 10 KB of data on the account. This model is similar to how checking accounts in banks require a minimum balance to have an account. It allows contracts that are maintaining important state to pay validators proportionally to the amount of data they are securing.\n",

                        "background_details": "As early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/block-size\">block size</a> began. However, discussions around the block limit largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. Supporters of bigger blocks believed that for Bitcoin to fulfill the vision of a peer-to-peer electronic currency as outlined in the original whitepaper, it was crucial to raise the block limit in order to increase transaction capacity. Bitcoin Cash proponents pushed for a system that could scale to VISA level transaction throughput without second layers and while maintaining affordable transaction fees. It rejected the philosophy of Bitcoin Core that Bitcoin's central value proposition is censorship resistance and trust-minimization, and that Bitcoin full nodes needed to be maximally decentralized to achieve this. Instead of envisioning Bitcoin as a settlement layer or a Digital Gold, Bitcoin Cash envisions Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, emphasizing Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange.\n\nIn 2017 at the Consensus conference amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly tense debate around the Bitcoin block limit, a meeting with miners and Core Developers took place in what is referred to as the “New York Agreement”, where an agreement was reached to support <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\">SegWit</a> and a 2MB <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork\">hard fork</a>. Known as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. Despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. They set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/soft-fork\">soft fork</a> to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017 they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. The 8MB block limit was later increased to 32MB in 2018 after another contentious hard fork regarding a minority faction's desire to raise the block limit to 128MB. This hard fork resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV, a fork of Bitcoin Cash. \n\nAlthough increased block capacity could increase transaction throughput on-chain, it could potentially restrict the universe of participants who could be capable of running full <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\">nodes</a>, thus making this something the community needs to address in order to be able to execute on its vision of a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system. In addition to pursuing on-chain scalability through larger block sizes, Bitcoin Cash prioritizes fast-paced development of technological improvements in opposition to the more conservative philosophy of Bitcoin. To date, Bitcoin Cash has 6 competing node implementations: BitcoinABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, BXT, Parity, Bitprim, and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash has also had a variety of upgrades, the most recent of which taking place of 05/15/2021. This upgrade made a variety of changes including the removal of the unconfirmed transaction limit, the enabling multiple OP_RETURNS, the implementation of double-spend proofs, , the inclusion of Cash Improvement Proposals (CHIPs) to introduce new specification changes to the protocol, and the inclusion of a new mining block default limit size of 8 MB.

As such, it went through two halvings to date; in November 2012, and again in July 2016, each cutting the initial block reward by half. On average, Bitcoin Cash generates new blocks every 10 minutes, rewarding miners with 12.5 new BCH and the total transaction fees from the preceding block. Each block has a 32MB limit and block rewards are <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/halving\">halved </a>every 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years). Eventually, once the 21 million BCH hard cap has been reached, block rewards will transition entirely to transaction fees shifting the security model of the protocol to one based on demand for block space versus one based on demand for BCH. Bitcoin Cash's next halving is expected to happen in May 2020.\n\nThe difference between BCH and BTC supply curves since the fork can be explained by the difficulty adjustment algorithm which included one addition compared to Bitcoin: the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA). This mechanism was set by the Bitcoin Cash developers to incentivize miners to prioritize BCH’s transactions over that of BTC’s. Miners leveraged this mechanism to maximize their profit by reducing their BCH mining output while waiting for the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment to reduce BCH’s difﬁculty, which in turn would lead to higher returns. As a result, 120,000 more BCH than BTC were mined from August 01, 2017, until November 13, 2017, when Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork to change the difficulty adjustment algorithm. \n\n",

A year later Hayden Adams began working on turning this idea into a functional product. After receiving several grants as well as $100,000 from the Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap launch in November 2018. The protocol quickly gained liquidity and started facilitating meaningful volume. Six months after launching, a fundraising round was <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/paradigm-backs-decentralized-exchange-protocol-uniswap\">completed</a>, led by Paradigm to allow the addition of two more employees.\n\nWhat makes Uniswap unique is that it solves the problem of high spreads for illiquid assets on order-book exchanges. This problem exists because there is little incentive for professional market makers to provide liquidity on very thinly traded assets. However, with Uniswap, anyone can be a market maker by depositing assets into a pool and earning fees based on the amount of trading activity. One downside to this model is that there is substantial slippage for large orders as the price paid increases as the quantity demanded increases.",

                        "technology_details": "Uniswap is a protocol that facilitates the exchange of tokens on Ethereum. Unlike most other DEXs, there is no native token and every action occurs on-chain. Typically, exchanges function by using an order-book where market makers set the price at which they are willing to buy and sell an asset. The difference between these prices is how they get paid for this work. Uniswap does away entirely with the order book and instead opts to have market makers deposit assets into a pool that traders can then trade against. The price is determined algorithmically based on the proportion of the two assets being traded.\n\nPrice mechanism\nUniswap uses what's known as a Constant Product Market Maker that is designed to always provide liquidity regardless of the order size or amount of funds in the pool. This is achieved by asymptotically increasing the price as the size of the buy order increases, leading to potentially significant slippage on large orders. Trading pools consist of an ERC-20 token and an equivalent amount of ETH, with the product between the two sums remaining constant. Any given transaction increases one sum while decreasing the other and the price changes based on the ratio between the two. Users can also swap between two ERC-20 tokens, however, Uniswap will perform two separate actions with each of their respective pools.\n\nProviding liquidity\nWhen liquidity providers add to a pool, they receive newly minted liquidity tokens entitling them to their proportion of the total pool as well as the 0.3% fee generated off each trade. These tokens are not speculative and simply keep track of how much of the pool is owed. Liquidity providers need to supply both assets in the same proportion they are currently at, otherwise, they will change the ratio and thus price. This would result in the immediate loss of money as the price change should get arbitraged out by trading bots. Even if providers supply the correct ratio of each asset, large price changes can result in the loss of money. (Details on how this work can be found here). Therefore, providers are hoping for substantial volume of trading around the price they entered such that the fees generated account for any potential losses.",

Chainlink aims to solve the oracle problem, an inherent limitation of blockchain networks that prevents them from connecting to external data resources that exist off-chain. Through a decentralized network of independent oracle node operators, Chainlink provides a wide range of decentralized services to smart contracts including Price Feeds (financial market data used to power a large portion of the DeFi economy), verifiable randomness (enabling the creation of dynamic NFTs and fair on-chain gaming applications), proof of reserve (providing proofof off-chain collateral that is backing stablecoins and cross-chain tokens), the Keeper Network (transaction automation bots that provide autonomous DevOps services), and more. \n\nThe recently released Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper also broadens the capabilities of Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) and describes how the Chainlink Network is evolving to provide both tamper-proof data delivery and secure off-chain computation. Chainlink oracle networks enable the creation of highly scalable and privacy-preserving hybrid smart contracts that combine on-chain and off-chain infrastructure. Off-Chain Reporting, a recent scalability upgrade of the Chainlink Network that lowered the gas costs of oracle updates by 90%, represents the first move towards achieving the goals laid out in the whitepaper.",

Chainlink is not a monolithic network like a blockchain but rather an infrastructure and framework for building blockchain-agnostic oracle networks that augment the capabilities of blockchains and layer-2 protocols.\n\nEach Chainlink oracle network consists of multiple independent oracle nodes that fetch data from multiple independent data providers, aggregate the data into a single data point, and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by smart contracts. Chainlink's flexible architecture allows for highly configurable oracle networks that can be composed of any selection of node operators and data providers and that use different network parameters such as update frequency, fee payment amounts, and more.\n\nChainlink nodes are operated by professional DevOps infrastructure providers, leading enterprises, and premium data providers who supply smart contracts with access to cryptographically signed data for additional security guarantees. Because of its flexible design, Chainlink can provide any type of data or computation to any smart contract application operating on any blockchain network.",

Assets on Stellar are issued and redeemed by anchors, who are trusted entities that issue digital credits on the Stellar network in exchange for deposits of the asset with the trusted entity. Anchors enable real world assets to be exchanged on Stellar by leveraging a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-exchanges\">distributed exchange</a> that maintains an order book for every asset pair.

With the creation of the non-for profit <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/stellar-development-foundation\">Stellar Development Foundation</a> (SDF), the team aimed to \"promote global financial access, literacy, and inclusion...and create an open and affordable financial system where people of all income levels can access simple-to-use, secure, and low cost financial services.\" The Stellar Development Foundation was created in collaboration with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. Stripe invested $3 million in seed funding and received 2 billion Stellar Lumens (XLM) in exchange. At launch the network generated 100 billion XLM and featured a 1% annual issuance rate. \n\nIn 2015, Stellar redesigned its consensus protocol following a ledger fork in 2014 that rolled back hours of transactions. It's new and current consensus protocol called \"Stellar Consensus Protocol\" was developed by Stanford professor <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-mazi-res\">David Mazières</a>, chief scientist of the SDF. In 2017, Jed McCaleb and Brit Yonge launched <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/interstellar\">Lightyear</a> as a for-profit entity of Stellar, that would build a universal payment network on Stellar. In 2017, Stellar announced a grants program that would award partners up to $2 million worth of Lumens for project development.\n\nIn October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.\n\nIn November 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/stellar-development-foundation-burns-more-than-half-of-lumen-supply-with-new-strategy-focus\">announced</a> it burned more than 55 billion XLM (~55%) tokens as it moves away from airdrop programs. Previously the foundation had retained 68 billion XLM earmarked for giveaways in order to grow the community. Citing a declining utility from airdrops, the SDF burned 50 billion of those tokens along with 5 billion of the 17 billion previously held in its operating fund. The burn reduced the total supply to 50 billion XLM of which SDF's ownership of the total dropped from XLM supply from 85% to 60%.\n",

Nevertheless, those distribution mechanisms initially designed by the SDF proved hard to effectively execute:\nOut of the 20 billion XLM to be distributed to Bitcoin holders (19 billion) and XRP holders (1 billion), only 2.037 billion were distributed in two rounds, in October 2016 and August 2017. The rest (17.963 billion) was re-allocated to the SDF operational budget in 2017. As such, the SDF increased its operational budget, initially set at 3 billion XLM by 600% through this re-allocation. \nOut of the 50 billion XLM to be distributed through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 4.2 billion XLM, less than 10% of what was originally planned. \nOut of the 25 billion XLM to be distributed through the Partnership program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 1.138 billion XLM, less than 5% of what was originally planned. It's also interesting to note that the address that received this 1.138 billion XLM sent then back to the SDF-managed address in November 2019, right before the SDF burnt 55 billion XLM, as detailed below. \n\nGlobally, the SDF only managed to distribute 7.375 billion XLM through these three programs, instead of the 95 billion initially scheduled. \n\nBuilt-in Inflation Mechanism\n\nUntil October 2019, the Stellar ledger also featured a built-in, fixed, nominal inflation mechanism. New Lumens were added to the network at a rate of 1% each year. Each week, the protocol would distribute these Lumens to any account that receives over 0.05% of the “votes” from other accounts in the network.  Given the very high supply concentration within the SDF treasury addresses due to the inefficiency of the distribution mechanisms, the SDF would receive over 95% of the votes, and thus 95% of the built-in inflation, increasing its operational budget by more than 4 billion XLM thanks to this built-in inflation mechanism. In October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.\n\n2017 Inflation Exploit\n\nFrom January to April 2017, Stellar suffered a serious inflation bug, <a href=\"https://messari.io/c/research/stellar-s-2017-inflation-exploit\">discovered in 2019 by Messari</a>. The bug was exploited, significantly inflationary, and patched with little publicity in April 2017. The attacker was able to create over 2.2 billion Lumens worth nearly $10 million at the time. Once it discovered and patched the bug, the SDF destroyed the equivalent number of coins that were created through the bug. Nevertheless, the XLM burned to offset the inflation bug came from the Direct Sing-up program allocation. As such, the SDF burnt supply that was meant to be distributed to the crowd to offset an inflation bug that was exploited by an attacker.\n\nOverhang burning\n\nConscious of the difficulty the distribute this important supply overhang, the SDF decided to burn more than 55 billion XLM in November 2019.\n37.6 billion XLM were burned from the Direct Sign-up Program allocation, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 4 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distributing 50 billion XLM through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8.2 billion XLM (4.2 billion distributed from 2015 to 2019 and 4 billion left to be distributed). \n12.988 billion XLM were burned from the Partnership program, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 8 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distribution 25 billion XLM through the Partnership program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8 billion XLM. \n4.88 billion XLM were burned from the SDF operational budget. Nevertheless, this burn only offset the newly issued XLM received through the built-in inflation during the first 5 years of the protocol. \n\nThrough this burn, the SDF reduced the maximum supply from 105 billion XLM to 50 billion XLM.

Quorum is a set of nodes sufficient to reach agreement. Given that an FBA system is open participation, meaning that participants can join and leave as they please, it is impossible for the system to know how many nodes are sufficient for quorum without knowing the identities and amounts of nodes in the system. Thus, FBA introduces a concept of quorum slices nodes. A quorum slice is a subset of a quorum that can convince one particular node about agreement. In an FBA system nodes broadcast and individually determine which quorums slices to trust, and build their own quorum based on the information they have at hand. In FBA systems it is crucial that these quoroms overlap to ensure the network reaches consensus. Ripple for example, provides a list of trusted validators to use in order ensure there is overlap when participating in the Ripple Consensus Protocol (RCP). \n\nConsensus in FBA systems is reached through a multi round process where validators share ledger candidates between each other, adding and subtracting transactions until their candidate proposals match what their validators in their quorom slice proposed. Once a supermajority is reached, each server independently computes a new ledger hash from the agreed-upon set of transactions and compares results. Once a super majority of validators agree upon the hash of the new ledger candidate, the ledger candidate is considered final.\n\nSCP differentiates itself from RCP in that validators can choose their own quorom slices rather than using a pre-defined one (from Ripple). Furthermore, rather than relying on a super majority of nodes for consensus SCP introduces notions of validator quality, where validators are weighted based on trustworthiness and reliability, and validator grouping, where validators are grouped by organization. SCP posit these additions allow for stronger quorums.\n",

The FBA is a fairly new consensus mechanism pioneered by Ripple. The SCP is the first provable safe FBA blockchain protocol.\n\nAn FBA allows nodes to choose which peers the trust based on intrinsic or extrinsic factors set by the nodes. This dynamic creates network-wide quorums as individual nodes relay and verify network activity information. FBAs rely on “quorum slices” to reach consensus—subsets of a quorum that can convince an individual node to agree with the “slice.” Stellar nodes can choose their own quorum slices.\n\nTo attack the Stellar network, a reputable institution would need to control 51% or more of the network’s trusted nodes. Stellar disinventivizes this by financial rewarding honest actors in the network via fees and other rewards. Stellar also adds an element of reputation and social identity by keeping network actors as known entities, which incentivizes financial institutions to maintain the trust of their peers.\n\nSome of these trusted financial institutions are called Anchors, a crucial part of the Stellar blockchain network. Anchors maintain wallets with fiat and XLM balances to allow currency exchange. Anchors control the fees they charge for network peers to use their services, and users can pick which anchor manages their exchanges.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain also supports launching native assets similar to issuing tokens on Ethereum. Compared to Ethereum, Stellar aims to offer faster transactions and lower network fees. All assets on the Stellar blockchain are not traded only by exchanging credits across between accounts in the network that are managed by anchors. ",

Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) deal with changes to the standards, protocols, and methods used in the ecosystem built on top of the Stellar network.

                        "background_details": "Before Frax launched in 2020, stablecoins that existed at the time were either collateral-backed or were minted and burned algorithmically. Collateralized stablecoins are not capital-efficient, while fully algorithmic stables are intrinsically fragile and are vulnerable to breakage in erratic market conditions. Frax Finance brings together the best of both worlds, eliminating their issues to produce the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol.\n\nThe project, which started in May 2019, was formerly called Decentral Bank and is founded by Sam Kazemian, Travis Moore, and Jason Huan. Since its launch, FRAX has had its supply partially backed by collateral and the rest of the supply left floating. The amount of supply that is backed is based on the collateral ratio of the protocol.\n\nFrax Finance is a two-token protocol made up of FRAX the stablecoin and Frax Shares which is its governance token. This structure is optimised to maintain the fiat peg stability, accrue seigniorage fees, and empower community members with governance rights. The protocol also makes use of a pool contract that holds USDC collateral. Further to the two-token model, the algorithm behind the minting and redemption of FRAX relies on interacting with the FXS token. For example, a collateral ratio of 75% would mean a newly minted FRAX of $1 value will be backed by $0.75 in a stablecoin asset, and $0.25 of Frax Shares will be burnt. At all times, the amount of FRAX minted would always be equivalent to the amount of value committed to protocol, either as collateral or by interacting with FXS.\n\nFrax v1 is the first iteration of the fractional algorithm used to create FRAX. The protocol uses fully on-chain oracles to obtain the prices of FRAX, FXS and collateral. The Uniswap oracle provides the time-weighted average prices of ETH, USDT and USDC while the Chainlink oracle provides the USD price. The v1 algorithm is essentially a banking algorithm that adjusts its collateral ratio (akin to a bank's balance sheet ratio) according to market forces, evidenced by arbitrage trades that occur on the FRAX and FXS tokens.\n\nIn March 2021, Frax v2 was launched, introducing the concept of Algorithmic Market Operations controllers (AMOs) as lego pieces to build and enact fully autonomous monetary policies on the Frax protocol. These AMOs would run on the foundation of the base stability mechanism conceptualized in Frax v1. At the time of writing, four AMOs are fully implemented and currently utilize the protocol's capital assets more efficiently, thus accruing even more value to FXS holders. Two more AMOs are currently in development and have to pass through the protocol's decentralized governance process before implementation.\n\nFrax's founder, Sam, has announced the development of a crypto native Consumer Price Index (CPI). The proposed CPI will have its own native stablecoin (Frax Price Index) and governance token (Frax Price Index Shares). The new product will enable FRAX to break free of the USD peg and become the first truly decentralized and permissionless crypto native unit of account. Holders of the new FPI token will experience an increase in the dollar-denominated value of their holdings every month. Hence, the FPI also seeks to serve as a hedge against inflation.",

                        "technology_details": "Frax introduced a novel stablecoin design hinged on fractional algorithmic stabilization. In its first version, Frax v1, the protocol used one Algorithmic Market Operations Controller (AMO) to achieve base stability. Here, the price of Frax was stabilized according to an arbitrage-like mechanism, allowing market forces to directly influence the fractionality of the collateral backing. The v1 algorithm essentially behaves like a banking algorithm that adjusts its balance sheet ratio (what we know as collateral ratio) according to market prices. A FRAX market price above $1 is an indication there is high demand, and the AMO decollaterizes forcing the market to sell/redeem more FRAX and pushing the price slightly back down. Conversely, if FRAX is priced below $1, recollaterization occurs which forces the price up, keeping a close peg to $1. In summary, the operation-agnostic protocol creates the exact amount of FRAX demanded by the market at the collateral ratio the same market demands for.\n\nWhile Frax v1 conceptualized fractional algorithmic stablecoins, Frax v2 is paving the way as a building block for a fully programmable monetary policy. Frax v2 introduces the AMO as a smart contract empowered to execute stablecoin monetary policies with zero impact on the collateral ratio and FRAX price. These AMOs would allow the protocol to efficiently leverage its assets by automating the movement of collateral to other capital efficient protocols across the DeFi ecosystem. Frax intends to implement multiple AMOs of this kind which would run on top of the base stability mechanism. With this kind of operation, Frax creates more value-accrual opportunities for its ecosystem without impacting the base layer stability mechanism that systematically maintains the fiat peg.\n\nFrax v2 is designed to run as many AMOs as possible that would improve the protocol, increase privacy and capital efficiency, and accrue more value to its governance token holders. AMOs can be proposed and built openly by the public but will pass through a governance vote before implementation. At the moment, there are four AMOs already implemented, and two more are still in development.\n\nCollateral Investor AMO: This rebalances idle USDC collateral to yield-generating DeFi protocols to earn cash flow for the protocol. The AMO has been designed to pull out invested collateral immediately in the event of large FRAX redemptions. Revenue earned from the investments is used to buy and burn FXS on the open market.\n\nCurve AMO: This is a stableswap AMO specific to its own FRAX3CRV pool which is liquidity-controlled and owned by the protocol. Similar in operation to the Collateral Investor AMO, FRAX and USDC are added/removed from the pool based on the collateral ratio to ensure FRAX is backed by sufficient collateral at all times.\n\nUniswap v3 AMO: The AMO has the leeway to enter positions on Uniswap v3 and mint FRAX against that position. This feature by the Uniswap v3 AMO provides expansion opportunities to other stablecoins and assets available on Uniswap v3.\n\nFRAX Lending AMO: As the name implies, this controller mints and lends out FRAX to DeFi platforms such as Compound. The FRAX minted into these platforms are not put in circulation unless they are overcollaterized by the borrower on the money market. This way, the AMO does not lower the collateral ratio. Although the AMO does not affect the collateral ratio, it can change the interest rate by minting or burning more FRAX.\n\nTornado Cash AMO: Tornado Cash is one of the two AMOs still in the development and proposal phase. The AMO's objective would be to anonymize all of FRAX's incoming supply when gas and other L2 optimization techniques are implemented on Ethereum. The controller would allow minting of FRAX directly into the FRAX-Tornado anonymity set leveraging on FRAX's expansion mechanisms as privacy enhancers.\n\nCollateral Hedge AMO: Frax currently accepts only stablecoins due to its relatively negligible volatility as compared with cryptocurrencies. The collateral hedge would enable Frax to accept more diverse and volatile collateral. This would be done by taking some amount of the volatile collateral and hedging against it with an inverse position, effectively netting out volatility in the collateral's price.",

The core team has full jurisdiction over non-controversial parameter adjustments, and every other proposal will pass through the community governance process.\n\nBefore proceeding to on-chain voting, all proposals must be posted on the governance forum for a period that varies according to the type of proposal. Meta-governance and FXS emission proposals require a 10-day minimum discussion period while other proposals that don't fall into the aforementioned categories must undergo a 5-day minimum discussion period.",

After a proposal has scaled through the discussion period, it can only be submitted on-chain if the submitting user/address holds at least 1% of the circulating supply of FXS, which currently stands at a one million FXS threshold. Users who cannot meet this threshold can combine votes with other community members and collectively submit their desired proposal.\n\nOn-chain voting is held on Frax's Snapshot and has a minimum duration of three days. 5000 FXS is the minimum voting power to start a valid voting process on Snapshot. At the end of the voting process, a simple majority will win the vote for or against the implementation of the proposal. Finally, a quorum of 10% of FXS circulating supply must validate the final vote on meta-governance and FXS emission proposals. All other proposals have a quorum requirement of 5%. Successful proposals are then queued into the Timelock for two days before it is implemented.",

Buyers have the right at any point during the first year of purchase to re-sell tokens back to the Foundation at 90% of the purchase price. Algorand initially planned to hold a series of these Dutch auctions to distribute a total of 3 billion ALGOs (30% of supply), but no further token sales have been announced.\n\nThe end of the sale coincided with the Algorand’s mainnet launch, which created 10 billion ALGOs at genesis. A total of 2.5 billion ALGO tokens (25% of the initial supply) were granted to the founders and the Algorand Foundation to support continued protocol development. The rest of the ALGO will be distributed through rewards, grants, and auctions as detailed in the supply curve section. "

The ALGOs will be introduced into the network over time as follows:\n\nEstimated ALGOs to be injected into circulation (initially via auction, distributed over time) - 2.5 billion\nEstimated participation rewards (distributed over time) - 1.9 billion\nEarly relay node runners (distributed over time) - 3.1 billion\nAlgorand, Inc. - 2.0 billion \nAlgorand Foundation - 0.5 billion\n\nAuction refund program\nIn Aug. 2019, Algorand offered auction investors the opportunity to receive a 90% refund on their purchased tokens. Investor returns totaled $19.9 million tokens, which constituted almost 80% of the original auction supply. The Algorand Foundation later burned these ALGOs as well as the 609,343.1208 AGLOs that address received as participation rewards (aka inflation), permanently removing them from circulation.\n\nIn Jun. 2020, the 2019 Algo auction participants who did not avail of the early redemption window in Aug. 2019 qualified to opt for a second and final Auction redemption window. Investor returns totaled five million ALGO. As occurred during the optional early redemption in August 2019, all Algos returned via this refund mechanism were burned (permanently taken out of circulation).\n\nRelay node accelerated vesting\nOn Sep. 30th, 2019, relay nodes voted in favor of delaying their ALGO payouts, which would allow Algorand and relay node operators to discuss potential modifications to the rewards schedule. Algorand investors USV and Pillar offered support for a new, elongated vesting schedule since the ALGO supply growth at the time was \"too large relative to the state of adoption.\" Relay nodes opted to delay their ALGO rewards twice more until the network passed EIP-11252019AF, which extended the vesting plan from two years to five years, meaning payouts would complete by the end of 2024. But this new schedule rewarded relay nodes by increasing their share of the ALGO supply by 25% and offered an accelerated vesting schedule should the price of ALGO reach specific targets.\n\nUnvested tokens dedicated to relay nodes will now vest according to the following guaranteed base vesting schedule:\nYear 1 (2020) 3% (for a total of 17%, as relay nodes had already received 14% of their total share at this point)\nYear 2 (2021), 8% (for a total of 25%)\nYear 3 (2022), 25% (for a total of 50%)\nYear 4 (2023), 35% (for a total of 85%)\nYear 5 (2024), 40% (for a total of 125%)\n\nAlthough this schedule can accelerate depending on the 30-day moving average of AGLO price, Algorand used the base vesting schedule to determine the supply curve.",

It becomes impossible for the minority to cheat and irrational for the majority to cheat the system as it would devalue their holdings. There is also no locking of tokens so a user has their tokens available at all times. Blocks are created in two phases where a single token is selected randomly and its owner proposes the next block. Subsequently, 1000 random tokens are selected with their owners then approving the block proposed by the first user. \n\nThese phases are ensured by the core protocol called Binary Byzantine Agreement, or Byzantine Agreement ★ (‘Star’), encompassing the following advancements:\nCryptographic sortition (self-selection) To prevent an adversary from targeting committee members, BA★ uses verifiable random functions (VRFs) to randomly select committee members in a private and non-interactive way. \nParticipant replaceability. BA★ mitigates adversary targeting a committee member by requiring committee members to speak just once, thus becoming irrelevant to BA★. \n\nExperimental results running on 1,000 Amazon EC2 VMs demonstrate that Algorand can confirm a 1 MByte block of transactions in ~22 seconds with 50,000 users, latency remains nearly constant when scaling to half a million users, it achieves 125X the transaction throughput of Bitcoin, and that Algorand achieves acceptable latency even in the presence of actively malicious users. \n\nA test network for the protocol was launched in July 2018, and the first open-source code was released on Github in October 2018. As such, Algorand encourages anyone to audit its version of the VRF, forked and extended from the widely popular libsodium cryptographic library.  ",

Community members can post code changes on the network, and stakeholders can use the Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus model to vote on whether to accept or reject the changes. Users are given the additional ability to reach a consensus on the parameters following a given outcome. For instance, if a proposal is accepted, community members collectively determine which block the update to implement. Any user can participate in Algorand’s governance system.\n\nAt the moment, the Algorand team constructs and releases protocol upgrades. But as described in the consensus-based approach above, node operators ultimately determine whether to accept or reject the code changes. Once Algorand releases a protocol upgrade, at least 90% of network nodes must approve the change (done simply by upgrading their node) before the code changes are considered active (i.e., are accessible to users and developers). If approved, the remaining network nodes have a grace period of 140,000 blocks (about seven days) to complete the upgrade before being \"kicked-off\" (unable to sync with) the network. This \"upgrade-required window\" recently increased from 10,000 blocks to 140,000 blocks with the activation of Algorand v2.0.2",

To bypass the hindrances such as limited performance and ad hoc governance that inherently exist in PoW chains, Cosmos was envisioned as a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable PoS blockchains. The ideal solution, according to Cosmos, was a tool for interacting with multiple parallel blockchains such that the unique value proposed by a chain can be expanded to any other chain.\n\nThe idea of a Proof-of-Stake blockchain with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism originates from the year 2014 when the future Tendermint Inc. co-founder Jae Kwon explored the possibilities in his research. With the participation of Ethan Buchman, the other Tendermint Inc. co-founder, this idea was further developed in 2015, and Cosmos was introduced in 2016. Tendermint Inc. and Interchain Foundation (ICF) have been responsible for the development and adoption of the technologies underlying the Cosmos network, Tendermint Core (a BFT consensus mechanism) and the Cosmos SDK (a modular framework for building new blockchains).\n\nICF ran a successful initial coin offering for ATOM in 2017 and used the collected funds to boost the development of Cosmos SDK, IBC, and Peggy. The first blockchain of the network, Cosmos Hub, launched on mainnet in 2019, and since then, many well-known projects have sprouted in the network such as Terra, THORChain, and Crypto.com.",

In order to bypass this shortcoming, Cosmos introduces account-based blockchains called peg zones (Peggy) and offers fast finality through implementing finality thresholds to blockchains with probabilistic finality.\n\nWhile Tendermint constitutes the networking and consensus layer of the application-specific blockchains built within the Cosmos network, Cosmos SDK offers a framework to construct the application layer by building deterministic state machines through SDK modules. Since the consensus mechanism and application layer are separate informational domains in Cosmos blockchains, the changes in the state-machines (e.g. transactions on the blockchain) are communicated to the Tendermint consensus engine through the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI). Another implication of this separateness is that the blockchains on the network are not limited by strict rules when choosing a consensus mechanism. They do not require to use of Tendermint's vanilla version and can make adjustments on the consensus mechanism to render it suitable for application-specific purposes.",

Any user can submit proposals on protocol upgrades, modifications to network parameters, bounty allocations, and other governance policies and participate in discussions on the Cosmos governance forum. Since community governance plays an essential role in the development and stability of the network, Cosmos Hub obliges each validator to vote on every proposal. Those who do not vote, get penalized by the protocol and their validator status gets deactivated for a predetermined period of time. The Cosmos Hub also benefits from an additional aiding agent named Governance Working Group which aims to equip Cosmos governance with structural tools, improve governance functionality, and conduct educational efforts to further the awareness and the adoption of Cosmos governance.",

                        "onchain_governance_details": "Proposals go through four different phases before either being accepted and executed or rejected.\n\n__Phase 1: The Deposit Period__ \nAnyone can submit a text proposal to the system, but the proposal needs to be backed with a minimum deposit of [64 ATOM](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/47)s within two weeks after the submission date to proceed into the voting phase.  This requirement is a protective measure against proposal spamming.  The party submitting the proposal does not necessarily need to provide the deposit themselves, or in other words, any ATOM holder can contribute to this deposit to support the proposal. Contributors can reclaim their tokens once the proposal gets accepted or if it fails to reach the minimum threshold after two weeks.\n\n__Phase 2: The Voting Period__ \nThe deposit period ends once the proposal reaches the minimum deposit amount and a two-week-long voting period begins. There are four voting options (“Yes”, “No”, “No with Veto”, “Abstain”). During the voting process;\n- Only staked (bonded) tokens can participate in governance.\n- Voting power is measured in terms of stake. The amount of ATOMs staked determines the direct influence of the user on the decision-making process (coin voting).\n- Delegators inherit the vote of the validators they are delegated to unless they individually cast their vote, which will overwrite validator decisions.\n__Phase 3: Tallying Results__ \nFollowing requirements need to be satisfied for a proposal to get a passing vote:\n- __Quorum__: More than 40% of the total staked tokens need to have participated in the vote.\n- __Threshold__: More than 50% of the tokens that participated in the vote (after excluding “Abstain” votes) need to have voted in favor of the proposal (“Yes”).\n- __Veto__: The number of votes cast for \"No with Veto\" shouldn't be greater than 33.4% of the tokens that participated (after excluding “Abstain” votes).\nThe proposal gets rejected if one of these requirements is not met at the end of the voting period. And if a proposal fails to pass the vote for any reason, the deposited tokens associated with the submission are not refunded and instead transferred to the community pool.\n\n__Phase 4: Implementing the Proposal__ \nAccepted proposals regarding protocol upgrades and network parameter modifications are integrated with a new version of Cosmos. Proposals regarding fund allocation, marketing activities, or any other decision that needs to be executed off-chain require additional operational management from the community.\n\n[List of current and part proposals](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals)",

The DAO was an Ethereum-based venture fund that managed to raise ~$150 million in Ether in an April 2016 <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\">initial coin offering (ICO)</a>.  A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the hacker to steal 3.6 million ETH of the funds collected in its ICO.\n\nA divide in the community formed around how to resolve the issue. One camp believed reverting the chain, thus erasing the hack from the network's history, was necessary to preserve the longevity of Ethereum. The other side reasoned mutability was antithetical to the ethos of crypto networks and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide led to a contentious hard fork at block 1,920,001, and the legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history rebranded to Ethereum Classic.\n\nBefore the DAO fork split the original Ethereum chain, there was just one group of users, service providers, developers, investors, and other network participants. The hard fork or \"irregular state change\" split not only the protocol layer but also the social and application layers. As the legacy chain, Ethereum Classic inherited the components outlined within the Ethereum whitepaper. At the time of the fork, Ethereum Classic was still identical to Ethereum regarding these original components. However, it soon began to diverge away from Ethereum by announcing its own roadmap and vision.\n\nPhilosophy and monetary policy change\nThe Ethereum Classic (ETC) community stresses the core principals of censorship resistance and (most prominently) immutability. And as a continuation of the Ethereum blockchain, it features a Turing-complete <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\">smart contract</a> language to support the development of more complex <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>. The Ethereum Classic community governs the network by the motto \"Code is Law,\" which instills the belief that ETC transactions and dApps are truly censorship-resistant and immune to any third party interference.\n\nETC later (March 2017) adopted a new, Bitcoin-like monetary policy fit with a fixed supply cap and disinflationary emission schedule. The proposal drastically deviated from the original Ethereum monetary policy, which remains in flux as Ethereum core devs look to establish a more concrete economic model for its future <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\">Proof of Stake (PoS)</a> network. Instead of monetary flexibility (and some uncertainty), Ethereum Classic now features a max supply of 210,700,000 tokens and miner reward reductions every five million blocks. And unlike Ethereum, the community intends to stick with <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof of Work (PoW)</a> as its consensus and token issuance mechanism.  \n\nDevelopment teams and future developments\nETC's structure varies from most blockchain projects, incorporating multiple development teams (IOHK, ETC Labs, and ETC Cooperative), each with their own goals. In general, most of these teams have focused on providing sidechain <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/scaling\">scaling</a> solutions, improving development tools (SDKs), and promoting cross-chain transactions so others can build on Ethereum Classic. Some of these efforts, including Connext's state channels and ChainSafe's bridge to Ethereum and Cosmos SDK-based chains, have already launched.\n\nETC is one of the few cryptocurrencies where investors can gain exposure to it through a traditional brokerage and or retirement account. Grayscale Investments created an Ethereum Classic Investment Trust (ticker ETCG) that allows investors to gain exposure to ETC without having to store or secure it directly.\n\n51% attacks\nAs a minority chain using the Ethash mining algorithm, Ethereum Classic has been the target of multiple 51% attacks. The first attack occurred in Jan. 2019, when crypto exchange Coinbase <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/updated-ethereum-classic-has-experienced-multiple-100-reorg-attack-ethereum-classic-claims-not-an-attack-new-miners-being-tested-coinbase-rebuts\">detected</a> a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain. The number of identified reorganizations eventually increased to a total of fifteen, twelve of which contained double spends, totaling 219,500 ETC (~$1.1 million).\n\nIn Aug. 2020, Ethereum Classic suffered three more 51% attacks. The first one resulted in a successful double-spend of 807,260 ETC (~$5.6 million at the time). The second attack occurred less than a week later and exhibited a similar reorg depth (about 4,000 blocks). The final Aug. 2020 attack resulted in a large reorg of 7,000 blocks, but there is no sign of a double-spend attempt as of yet. As for a possible solution, the ETC Cooperative would like to switch Ethereum Classic's hashing algorithm from Ethash to either Keccak-256 or SHA-3, which would mean Ethereum Classic would no longer be a minority chain and would potentially be less susceptible to similar attacks.",

The sale took place between Jul. 22, 2014, and Sep. 2, 2014. The remaining 12 million ETH (20% of the initial supply) were allocated to the Foundation and early contributors. Of the ether sent to the Foundation:\n3 million were allocated to a long-term endowment\n6 million were distributed among 85 developers who contributed prior to the crowdsale\n3 million were designed as a “developer purchase program” that gave Ethereum developers the rights to purchase ETC at crowdsale prices.\n\nAll other ETH (and now ETC) issuance that took place occurred through the process of Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining.\n\nThe Fork Distribution\nWhen Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split following the DAO fork (on July 20, 2016), anyone who held ETH now owned equivalent amounts of ETH and ETC. When a contentious hard fork occurs, users of the original chain can claim the native asset issued on the new chain, if different. Since the Ethereum Foundation trademarked the name \"Ethereum\" and the \"ETH\" ticker, the legacy chain opted to rebrand itself to \"Ethereum Classic\" and use the ticker \"ETC\" for its native asset."

Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/mining\">mining</a> pool could obtain a majority of the <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hash-power\">hash power</a> on a given chain.\n\nThe GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/orphan-block\">orphan blocks</a> in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain byweighingthe parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.\n\nMining\nEthereum Classic miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash as defined by the network's <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\">difficulty adjustment</a> algorithm. Ethereum Classic recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.\n\nCryptographers designed Ethash to be <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\">ASIC</a>-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. Since Ethereum and Ethereum Classic share the same mining algorithm at the moment, ASIC miners on Ethereum can shift their hash power over to Ethereum Classic to mine ETC. This opportunity combined with lower security spend on Ethereum Classic likely led to the various <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/51-attack\">51% attacks</a> registered on Ethereum Classic, the first of which occurred in Jan. 2019 followed by three more in Aug. 2020.\n\nLearn more:\nEthereum Classic Node Documentation\nETC Nodes (Ethereum Classic Node Tracker",

                        "technology_details": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) kept most of the original Ethereum technical features and architecture. It remains an account-based blockchain (as opposed to Bitcoin's <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/utxo\">UTXO</a> model) consisting of external accounts, which are controlled by a user’s private keys, and contract accounts, which are managed by contract code. External contracts can create and sign messages to send to both types of accounts, while contract accounts can only execute transactions automatically in response to a message they have received. The latter are what are known as <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\">smart contracts</a> and enable the programmability of <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>.\n\nEthereum Classic also continues to use the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/ethereum-virtual-machine\">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a>, the smart contract execution engine. It is a Turing-complete virtual machine featuring a specific language “EVM bytecode,” typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity or others such as the Python-based Vyper. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum Classic node operators and miners provide these resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas.\n\nThe fee to make transactions or execute smart contract operations on ETC is (gas price) * (gas limit), and fees are paid to miners for including your transactions in a block. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas users are willing to spend on a transaction, whereas the gas price is the cost users are willing to pay for each gas unit. A normal transaction on the network costs 21,000 gas but costs more if you are trying to execute something more complex as that requires more computational power. Users can also speed up their transactions by raising the gas price since that will incentivize miners to include the transaction(s) in the next block to receive those fees.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) uses Ethash as its <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. New blocks are generated every 15 seconds, on average, and the current miner reward for each new block found is 3.2 ETC which is reduced by 20% every 5 million blocks (about 2.4 years). ETC will be mineable until around 2070 when miners will reach the soft supply cap of between 210 million and 230 million. In addition to miner rewards, ETC rewards miners for discovering “uncle blocks”. Uncle blocks are valid blocks that arrived too late, meaning another miner already solved the PoW and claimed that block height's reward. This practice aims to decrease mining centralization, reduce the chance of unintentional forks, and boost network security. Every new block can contain at most two uncle blocks. Uncle block rewards are 3.125% of the miners' reward or 0.125 ETC.",

In this model, anyone can submit code changes, dubbed Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIP), that aim to either modify the core protocol or even the ECIP process itself. The ECIP process takes after the EIP and BIP systems used in Ethereum and Bitcoin, respectively.\n\nOnce the author submits a proposal, they must champion it to be successful, which consists of the author making themselves available to answer any questions from network stakeholders. Proposals must also pass through several stages before being implemented into node client software.\n\nProposals begin in the “Draft Stage,” and if successful, make their way to the “Accepted Stage.” Submissions must pass each stage by a rough consensus. Client developers may add the submitted changes to their clients at their discretion. There are no on-chain voting mechanisms Ethereum Classic relies on to make changes.\n\nLearn more:\nECIP Repository\nECIP Directory\nECIP 'Issues Section'\nDiscord ECIP Channel",

Bytecoin launched in March 2014; however, after a controversial 80% premine, a Bitcointalk forum user known as thankfulfortoday forked the codebase of Bytecoin into the a new project named BitMonero, a compound of Bit (as in Bitcoin) and Monero (meaning \"coin\" in Esperanto). \n\nThe release of BitMonero was poorly received by the community that initially backed it, leading seven community members to fork BitMonero into a new project called Monero. This largely pseudonymous group, led by Fluffypony (<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/riccardo-spagni\">Riccardo Spagni</a>), ultimately became the first Monero Core team. Monero launched its project in April 2014 with no premine. \n\nMonero's payment anonymity has garnered significant attention from a panoply of crypto-curious persons. Since its launch Monero has become one of the most widely used darknet currencies in the world due to its anonymity by default features. In 2017 Monero further enhanced its privacy features by incorporating Ring CT signatures, a solution proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell, that obscures transaction amounts for each entry in the ring signature, in addition to obscuring the transaction address. This provided near complete transaction anonymity in contrast to just sender anonymity as it was previously. In October 2018, Monero implemented bulletproofs, a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs\">zero-knowledge proof</a> technology that replaced the previous zero-knowledge range proofs that its confidential transactions relied on. Bulletproofs cut the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent, significantly increasing transaction efficiency. \n\nMonero undergoes scheduled hard forks every six months intended to allow Monero to evolve at a regular cadence, while still leaving users enough time to update before being forked away from the network. These hard forks tend to include everything from patches and bug fixes to hashing algorithm changes and functionality upgrades.\n\nIn December 2019, Fluffypony (Riccardo Spagni), Monero's lead maintainer <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/monero-s-fluffypony-steps-down\">stepped down</a> from the project in an effort to further decentralize the project.

Consensus in Monero, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work, that would invalidate the current chain.\n\nMining\nMiners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using the RandomX proof-of-work algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hash-function\">hash</a> less than the target number set by Monero's <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. The target difficulty level is adjusted every block.\n\nIn the pursuit of decentralization at the miner level, Monero periodically changes its proof-of-work algorithm via hard forks to ensure Monero remains ASIC resistant and open to individuals with commodity hardware. Like many proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hash-power\">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block. This is to smooth individuals' mining revenue as mining has become more competitive. \n\nBlock sizes in Monero are dynamic and there is no preset block size limit like there is in Bitcoin. However, despite there being no block size limits, Monero has a block reward penalty system that keeps block sizes in check. The block reward penalty system works first by taking the median size of the last 100 blocks. If a new block's size is greater than that median, then the block reward gets reduced quadratically depending on how much the new block size exceeds that median. The maximum block size is set at two times the median of the last 100 blocks, and as the block size approaches that limit the block reward approaches zero. ",

                        "technology_details": "Monero, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/utxo\">unspent transaction output </a>(UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of dynamic-sized data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/mempool\">mempool</a>) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Monero's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Monero uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. \n\nMonero runs a proof-of-work algorithm called RandomX, an algorithm using random code execution and memory-hard techniques for ASIC resistance. Monero initiates hard forks every 6 months to implement upgrades to the protocol, often times changing its PoW algorithm to prevent ASICs from joining the network.\n\nMonero's privacy enhancements stem from ring signatures, which mask sender identities and offers single-use keys to make transactions untraceable. Ring signatures merge a group of signers together to better preserve the anonymity of the true signer. The group is comprised of the actual signers single use key initiating the transaction and past transaction outputs from Monero’s blockchain. Including past transaction outputs helps preserve the senders anonymity because they are theoretically indistinguishable to an outside observer as the valid transaction itself. \n\nIn January 2017, Monero implemented Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring CTs) in an effort to combat concerns around the true degree of anonymity offered by Monero. Ring signatures only provided privacy for the sender of the transaction, and required outputs to be broken up into separate rings because ring signatures could only contain outputs of the same value. Ring CT signatures aimed to alleviate these concerns by obscuring transaction amounts for each entry in the ring signature, in addition to obscuring the transaction address. With Ring CTs wallets could arbitrarily select ring members from any output size. To prove that certain amounts were spent, Ring CTs used range proofs, a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs\">zero knowledge cryptography</a> technique used to prove the amount used in a transaction with revealing the details. \n\nHowever, the range proofs used in Monero's confidential transactions to ensure the integrity of transactions, were computationally intensive, leading the Monero blockchain to bloat due to the onerous data requirements of each transaction. Thus, in October 2018 Monero implemented bulletproofs, which addressed this scalability issue, cutting the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent and significantly increasing transaction efficiency. Bulletproofs are a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof that does not require a trusted setup. Bulletproofs aggregate information into new data structures that scale logarithmically, rather than linearly, allowing even greater scaling for larger transactions that contain multiple outputs.",

Once new code has been implemented into the Monero Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.\n\nMonero funds protocol development through its Forum Funding System (FFS), a donation based crowdfunding system. The FFS is a system whereby anyone can propose ideas and request anonymous donations to fund development work. Once proposals have been funded, funds are released as certain milestones are reached.    \n\nMonero opts for scheduled hard forks every six months. The community believes that not only does this ensure the protocol is continuously being improved at a regular cadence, but it also keeps the community engaged in the governance process. ",

Business applications can be built on top of Thor for smart contract creation and data auditing. VeChain plans to develop Thor smart contract development with visualization tools and support for multiple languages.\n\nVeChain IDs are a key component of the VeChain blockchain. Physical good tracked with VeChain are assigned digital identities created with a SHA256 hash and tracked with NFC, RFID, and QR codes. \n\nVeChain uses a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism that relies on masternodes to validate transactions. Authoritative masternodes are selected by the VeChain Foundation and the VeChain community after Know Your Customer (KYC) processes.\n\nVeChain’s blockchain circulates two tokens. The first, VET, is the network’s primary medium of exchange for governance and payments. The second, VeThor (VTHO), is a token for a lower transaction fee model that is credited to VeChain users daily based on the amount of VET they hold. VeThor is used to executing smart contracts and transactions on the VeChain blockchain. \n\nVeChain blockchain users are categorized as users and service providers. VeChain users include manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and other enterprise clients. Service providers build specific applications on the network like smart contracts and other blockchain-based software applications. ",

Being non-Turing complete, DeFi transactions on DeFiChain flow quickly and smoothly at low gas rates, and have reduced risk of smart contract errors. \n\nDeFiChain currently supports tokenized BTC, ETH, USDT, DOGE, LTC, and BCH on the DeFiChain DEX, which enables liquidity mining (yield farming) for these coins.",

However, current systems are still far from providing financial services that are truly under the control of the people who use them. The goal of DeFiChain is to give people (and in the future, machines and devices) seamless access to decentralized financial services, by bringing full DeFi capabilities to the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn 2019, the team identified the core challenges to bringing DeFi mainstream \nMost general purpose platforms like Ethereum require a large amount of coding to provide financial services, increasing the risk of hackability or bugs in the code.\nThere are large issues with scaling on many of these platforms — increased usage of a particular dApp affects the gas prices for all transactions on the platform.\nGovernance models of most of today’s blockchains are immature and showing signs of politicization, centralization and uncertainty. \nDeFi is concentrated to a few platforms — hence the space is missing out on a big part of the crypto market.\nThe solution to the challenges were suggested as:\nBuild a blockchain specially for DeFi use cases\nBuild on top of Bitcoin and anchor to the Bitcoin blockchain for maximum security\nSupport all major cryptoassets\nUltilize a hybrid proof of stake and work consensus mechanism\nIncorporate on-chain governance system\n\nWith atomic swap interoperability on Bitcoin and other major crypto projects, DeFiChain aims to enable crypto users to seamlessly transact over a wide array of financial instruments in a fully unrestricted, decentralized, fast and secure manner with low transaction fees.\n\nThe initial function set of DeFiChain includes decentralized lending, wrapping of tokens, pricing oracles, exchanges, futures trading (equities and commodities), transferable debts and receivables, non-collateralized debt, asset tokenization distribution of dividends.",

To run a masternode (staking node), stakers must hold 20,000 DFI as collateral. Masternodes on DeFiChain participate in active transaction validations and block creations. \n\nOn DeFiChain, DeFi capabilities are implemented through non-Turing smart contracts – via implementation of opcode support for DeFi instruction sets. The DeFi opcode complements and works in tangent with the Script scripting language of the existing Bitcoin Core protocol. To further enhance security, DeFiChain periodically anchors its block to the Bitcoin blockchain via Merkle root. This enhances the immutability of DeFiChain, by leveraging on the security of the Bitcoin blockchain.",

While blockchains are the most commonly used DLTs, Hedera is slightly different since it uses a new consensus algorithm known as hashgraph. The hashgraph consensus algorithm aims to process and finalize more transactions at scale than traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks, as they are often characterized by high latency and low transactions per second (tps). Hedera's state is stored on mainnet nodes, which are all currently run by members of the Hedera Governing Council. But in the future, mainnet nodes will be permissionless. These nodes secure the Hedera ledger by reaching a consensus on the validity and order of transactions.\n\nHedera provides two core network services: the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) and the Hedera Token Service (HTS). HCS allows clients to submit messages to the Hedera network for consensus timestamping and ordering, but it doesn't require the consensus nodes to store state related to that message. Instead, application state or data is persisted off-chain, where HCS users can define confidentiality and access control that cater to their use-case. The HTS supports native tokenization, whereby clients can create and manage various token types. Token controls include managing supply and KYC compliance, along with native atomic swaps and multi-sig capabilities.",

Hedera layers Proof-of-Stake for consensus weighting, a fee & rewards model, a cryptocurrency, and the two key HCS and HTS services on top of hashgraph, Hedera's consensus algorithm. Since hashgraph has the potential to process transactions at a comparatively efficient rate, Hedera intends to be a platform that can support high-volume use cases, such as micropayments, data integrity, and tokenization. The network also supports a virtual machine that can compile smart contracts written in Solidity, similar to the EVM. Hedera intends to be compliant across jurisdictions by offering native support for optional KYC and AML checks via its \"Verified Identity\" mechanism.\n\nHedera will launch in a permissioned model with only the governing members running nodes. Over time, as the distribution of the network's native token, HBAR, improves, the node membership will transition from permissioned to fully permissionless, where any network participant can operator a Hedera consensus node.\n\nEntities Behind the Network\nHedera Hashgraph LLC is a US-based entity that is governed by 39 term-limited global enterprises across multiple industries. These entities manage Hedera's consensus nodes while collaborating to determine the protocol's future direction (i.e., Hedera's near-term governance model). Governing members are responsible for council membership, regulating network rules and tokens, and approving changes to the protocol. They also elect subcommittees that will operate traditional corporate functions such as Legal, Finance, and Marketing departments. Governing members receive fees from operating nodes to compensate for their security and governance contributions, but they do not take profits from the entity in their role as members.\n\nSwirlds is a separate company that owns the intellectual property of the hashgraph consensus algorithm and is an equal-weight governing member. Swirlds has licensed the technology to Hedera Hashgraph. The two entities will use the associated patent rights to legally prohibit anyone from forking the code and creating a competing platform and currency. While the consensus algorithm is not open source, it is \"open review,\" meaning anyone can verify there are no backdoors in the code. Additionally, Hedera's application development layer is open; no license is required to build Hedera applications.",

Fees serve to inhibit DoS (Denial of Service) attacks by making such attacks financially prohibitive. Fees are denominated in USD but charged in HBAR. The exchange rate between the two is updated hourly to give clients stability in prices irrespective of fluctuation in HBAR price.\nNetwork Security via Staking: A node's influence towards the determination of consensus timestamp and order is weighted by the number of HBARs the node itself has in its account and (to be implemented at a future date) the number of HBARs that other non-node accounts proxy to that node.\nIncentivizing Security (Staking Rewards): Nodes (and those that proxy their HBARs to nodes) will receive daily reward payments as per the participation in validating transactions during that period."

Before the Hedera network opened to the public, 6.7 million HBAR were set aside for the community testing program, while the rest remained in the Hedera Treasury account. When the network opened access to the public on Sept. 16, 2019, 45.09% of the total 50 billion HBAR were allocated to early management, employees (current and future), SAFTs (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) investors, advisors, community earn programs, and enterprise and developer grants. The rest (54.91%) remained in the Hedera Treasury.\n\nPrivate SAFTs\nHedera issued three SAFTs, with the first SAFT being offered in December 2017 and the final SAFT round closing in August 2018. In the aggregate, 17.45% of all HBAR were sold in these private rounds. Hedera’s co-founders and early executives also acquired tokens through a SAFT as part of their compensation. Dr. Baird and Mr. Harmon (“The Founders”) each have a coin grant of two billion HBAR in total allocation (4% of total supply), each vesting over six years. Other senior executives who joined Hedera prior to March 2018 received an aggregate of 3.5% of the total coin supply via SAFTs and coin grants.\n\nAdditional Allocations\nHedera compensated employees, advisors, vendors, and other service providers in the form of Restricted Coin Units (RCUs), whereby individuals vest into a right to receive a select amount of HBAR. Hedera created a reserve of 8.1 billion HBAR for the coin plan that covers RCUs.\n\nHedera issued Swirlds (which owns patents on the hashgraph technology) a one-time allocation of 5% of the total supply of HBAR and allocated 1.24 billion tokens to the developer community and ecosystem reserve funds.\n\nNo more than 34% of the total HBAR is expected to be released until 2025.\n\nHedera will remain a permissioned network until the total value of all the circulating HBAR is high enough to be prohibitively expensive for a malicious user (or group of users) to acquire enough tokens to conduct an attack."

SAFT Series 3 resulted in 922 million coins sold in total, which represents 11% of all coins sold via SAFTs and approximately 1.9% of the total coin supply.\n\nThis sale offered purchases HBAR at $0.096 per coin (based on a total supply of 50 billion coins) with a 4-year release schedule (annual distributions) with 20% of coins to be released no sooner than 6 months after Network Launch followed by 20% of coins released annually over the following four years. A total of 302 purchasers chose SAFT Series 3B, investing a total amount of $22.3 million for 242 million coins. The first release of coins under SAFT Series 3B occurred at Open Access on September 16, 2019, and subsequent releases will occur on September 16 each year from 2020-2023.\n\n__Learn More:__\n[How did Hedera raise funds?](https://help.hedera.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007219337)",

Overall, Hedera raised $124 million via SAFTs. The SAFTs were offered at a fixed price per token, not a discount to a future sale price. The initial two rounds of SAFTs have long release schedules of three to four years, while the final SAFT round offered a choice between a four-year release schedule and an eight-month release schedule. The first two SAFT seed rounds were at a price of close to zero dollars. The third SAFT was available with two pricing options and different release schedules, either 12 cents for a release schedule over 8 months or 9.6 cents for a 4-year release. \n\nThe maximum outstanding supply (50,000,000,000 HBARs) was minted at launch. \n\n54.11% was allocated to the Hedera Treasury, 5% was allocated to Swirlds and 2.6% was allocated to a Market Development Fund. These HBARs will be released over 15 years as displayed on the supply curve. \n\n2.42% was allocated to the Community Earn Programs, with 0.46% in the process of being distributed to the community as part of Hedera’s community testing program and 1.96% set aside for a committed earn program.\n\n15.52% was allocated to Employees, 2.9% to Advisors, Vendors and others contributing parties and 17.45% was allocated to Investors. The remaining hbars under the SAFTs and agreements with employees, advisors, and vendors will be distributed over varying periods of time up to six (6) years after open access, with the co-founders and other early senior executives having the longest distribution schedules.",

The Hashgraph consensus algorithm is Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT). Every node participates in every round of consensus, meaning it doesn't rely on a single node or \"leader\" to order transactions each round. The consensus is ''fair in that it doesn’t allow a leader to censor or unduly delay a given transaction.\n\nIn addition to ordering transactions, Hashgraph also issues a consensus timestamp for each transaction, calculated as the time at which the transaction reached a majority of the network. Once the consensus timestamp is determined then the transaction is final, which contrasts most Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks that rely on probabilistic finality. A formal proof of the consensus algorithm is available here. Hedera's fee model is not auction-based, a common model among most networks for submitting transactions. Without the concept of a fee auction, users can't pay more in fees to increase the likelihood of their transactions being ordered before transactions that may have been submitted earlier.\n\nHashgraph aims to process a high number of transactions per second (TPS) with low latency. The team has said Hedera's hashgraph consensus allows it to support over 10,000 transactions per second. The nature of these transactions has been disputed, as the 10,000 number may only represent cryptocurrency transactions and not any smart contract interactions. These disputes can be found here and here, while the Hedera team has issued a few rebuttals here and here.\n\nAs for how Hedera achieves this reportedly high TPS, it leverages two core components within Hashgraph: gossip about gossip and virtual voting. These components, along with weighting votes by stake, enable nodes to determine the consensus order of transactions. More information can be found here.",

                        "technology_details": "Hashgraph Consensus\nHedera uses hashgraph consensus, an alternative to blockchain consensus mechanisms. It achieves a lower latency on transaction finality because once consensus on the timestamp and order of transactions is reached, those transactions are applied to the state in that order. Hashgraphs attempts to remove the reliance on fee-based auctions for transaction inclusion, which can lead to greater fees when the native token fluctuates in price and the potential for higher levels of MEV (miner extractable value).\n\nConsensus Nodes\nHedera's public ledger being stored and run by the Hedera Governing Council. While running mainnet node is currently limited to Council members, Hedera eventually plans to make its network permissionless, allowing any participant to run a consensus node. Hedera nodes come to consensus on the validity and order of transactions. When the network transitions to a permissionless state, the influence of each node towards consensus will be weighted by the number of HBAR in their account. Hedera will run PoS (Proof-of-Stake) but without any stake bonding or slashing penalties. Hashgraph will function as the consensus and security layer, while the PoS layer will deter DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.\n\nConsensus nodes (currently run by Council members) will receive daily payments to compensate for their bandwidth, storage, and computing costs. These daily payments will be proportional to the stake the nodes have designated. Other accounts that proxy their stake to a node will receive smaller payments to incentivize them to select valid nodes.\n\nMirror nodes offer a cost-effective way to query historical data without trust loss. The key network services are cryptocurrency, consensus, and token services.\n\nNetwork Fees\nClients pay fees in HBARs for the network to process a transaction. The network attempts to keep fees low. For instance, transferring HBARs between accounts costs approximately $0.0001 USD according to the team. Fees are denominated in USD but charged in HBAR. Clients are given stability in fees since the network updates the exchange rate between HBAR and USD every hour to reflect the market price.",

The governance model is more traditional, using a model pioneered by National BankAmericard Inc. (now VISA) in 1968. It is designed in a way to incentivize the governing council to do what’s in the best interest of the Hedera network and discourage a single company from assuming total control. It also aims to prevent the Hedera Governing Council from being unduly influenced by individual members or node operators.\n\nThe hashgraph consensus algorithm is proprietary but “open review;” therefore, the network and its cryptocurrency cannot be forked by third-party developers, but the underlying code is available to the public for review.\n\nCurrent Governing Council members include:\nAvery Dennison\nBoeing\nDentons\nDeutsche Telekom\nDLA Piper\nEDF\neftpos\nFIS\nGoogle\nIBM\nLG\nMagalu\nNomura\nStandard Bank\nSwirlds\nTata Communications\nUniversity College London (UCL)\nWipro\nZain Group",

                        "background_details": "Filecoin is looking to provide an alternative to traditional online storage providers and protocols. Its technology acts as an incentive layer for the peer-to-peer file transfer system IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which uses hash-addressed content structures to store data instead of centralized servers and IP addresses. This is intended to reduce redundancy, increase permanence, and improve efficiency. \n\nFilecoin incentivizes IPFS by rewarding storage providers and retrievers for contributing resources to the system. The network also comes with built-in Ethereum integration allowing developers to access data on Ethereum’s blockchain and interact with its smart contracts.\n\nFilecoin is being developed by Protocol Labs, a development firm founded in 2014 by Juan Benet. Benet and crew constructed Filecoin and IPFS in tandem, raising a few Seed equity rounds to fund the process. In 2017, the team hosted a token sale to secure funds for Filecoin's development, which raised around $205 million in one of the largest token offerings at the time.\n\nProtocol Labs seeks to build a fundamental layer for data infrastructure that can be used by both blockchain and traditional providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. The project plans to achieve this goal by creating a marketplace in which any user who has storage capacity can connect to the network, creating a supply of unused storage both in consumer hardware as well as data centers of existing businesses. The Filecoin team believes this will reduce the price of storage in a way similar to how sharing economy companies like Airbnb reduced the price of short-term rentals in marketplaces traditionally dominated by large players with large capital requirements.",

It raised these funds using a relatively new method known as a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT). The SAFT is a legal agreement inspired by the Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), pioneered by Y Combinator. It gives accredited investors an allocation of tokens once the network is live in return for an upfront investment.\n\nOf the $205 million raised, $52 million was sold to advisors at a rate of $0.75 per FIL token, with an additional discount of between 0% and 30%. Vesting for advisors ranged from one to three years. The remaining $153 million was raised from investors with FIL tokens priced based on a linearly increasing function. The starting price for the sale was $1.00 per FIL and increased up to $5.00 per FIL using the formula (price = $ amount raised / 40 million), with a hard cap of 200 million FIL sold.  Investor tokens, from the advisor and token sale rounds, will vest on variable periods with a six-month minimum.\n\nFIL has a max supply of two billion, of which 600 million were pre-allocated at genesis according to the following allocations (percentages based on max supply):\n10.5% was allocated to Protocol Labs with a 6-year linear vesting\n4.5% was allocated to Protocol Labs team member and contributors with a 6-year linear vesting\n7.5% was allocated to 2017 SAFT investors with a 6-month to 3-year linear vesting\n2.5% was allocated to future fundraising or ecosystem development\n5% was allocated to the Filecoin Foundation with a 6-year linear vesting\n\nThe remaining 70% of the total supply is allocated to Filecoin miners and will be released over time to reward providing data storage service, maintaining the blockchain, distributing data, and running applications."

Clients (network users) can source miners of data storage and data retrieval, different operations that existing within separate decentralized markets. PoSt provides a level of verifiability so that data can be stored and retrieved in a distributed, multi-market system.\n\nMining\nStorage miners can earn FIL by storing data for clients and \"computing cryptographic proofs to verify storage across time.\" Unlike Proof-of-Work mining, the probability of earning a block reward (and transaction fees) is \"proportional to the amount of storage the miner contributes to the network.\"\n\nOn the other hand, retrieval miners can receive FIL by winning bids for a client request. The market value of the file in question determines the miner's payout. Available bandwidth and initial response time for details (which could be influenced by network latency or proximity to a client) impact a miner's ability to close deals and retrieve data on the network. Therefore, the \"maximum bandwidth of a retrieval miner will set the total quantity of deals\" they can win.\n\nWith the network still in development, the mining equipment specifications (specifically for CPU and RAM) remain unknown. But the team insists the mining hardware will contain configurations with many standard hard drives and that any “specialized Filecoin mining hardware” will not exceed anything more than a highly optimized hard drive (in a sense, not optimal for ASICs). Filecoin also notes note that early storage and retrieval miners will be required to run full nodes.\n",

                        "technology_details": "Protocol Labs introduced many new technologies in its Filecoin whitepaper that could add value to multiple blockchain projects. Filecoin is secured by proof-of-work in the same way that bitcoin is, but this work is specifically related to storage of data Instead of finding a random nonce to make the block hash fit in a target range, the networks proof-of-work is restricted to proving that a miner has stored data for a specific duration and replication. This is achieved with two new types of proof-of-work: proof-of-replication (PoRep) and proof-of-spacetime (PoSt). \n\nProof-of-replication allows a server to convince a user that some data has been replicated to its own uniquely dedicated physical storage while proof-of-spacetime allows an efficient prover to convince a verifier that they are storing some data for a specified duration of time. \n\nThese proofs allow Filecoin to solve issues with large-scale storage networks made of independent parties, by making it theoretically impossible to falsify data storage records to increase miner rewards. Competitors like Siacoin ($SC) and Storj ($STORJ) lack this functionality, though they have not yet created enough storage demand for this to be a significant issue. \n\nMiner proofs are used to create a network based on three primary methods, put, get, and manage. The put and get methods are responsible for putting data in storage and accessing it on client request respectively. The manage method is responsible for managing the marketplace by matching buy and sell orders as well as managing buyer and seller reputation on the platform. \n\nThese methods are executed across two marketplaces, storage and retrieval, which are managed by the different miners. Protocol Labs believes that miners will often participate in both markets. Storage miners are responsible for receiving put requests and storing client data while also pledging collateral proportional to the data. They will be penalized by losing this collateral in the event of invalid or missing proofs. Storage providers run the manage method in conjunction with clients and auditors. Retrieval miners are responsible for managing get requests and giving clients their data. While retrieval miners do not need to pledge collateral, they are still compensated in the native Filecoin for performing work for the network. ",

DFINITY’s vision is for its new internet infrastructure to support a wide variety of end-user and enterprise applications, such as social media, messaging, and data storage.\n\nThe project was founded as DFINITY in October 2016 by Dominic Williams. DFINITY raised a total of $121 million from contributors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, SV Angel, Aspect Ventures, Electric Capital, ZeroEx, Scalar Capital, and Multicoin Capital. In 2018, the DFINITY Foundation distributed ICP tokens to 50,000+ registered participants through an airdrop.\n\nOn December 18, 2020, DFINITY launched the alpha mainnet of the Internet Computer. The team then launched the Internet Computer into the public domain on May 10, 2021. Its public launch also marked the release of the Internet Computer’s source code and the ICP utility token's transaction and governance functionalities.",

The Network Nervous System (NNS) governance mechanism converts ICP to cycles at a variable rate. This rate is chosen to ensure users of the network can always create new cycles at an approximately constant cost in real terms, such that the cost of acquiring fuel is predictable. \nParticipant Rewards: The network mints new ICP to reward and incentivize those contributing to the network and enabling it to function. These contributions include (1) the provision of “voting rewards” to those participating in governance, (2) the provision of “compute rewards” to those operating the node machines hosting the network, and (3) other miscellaneous activities."

The sale distributed 24.72% of the total ICP supply. A year later (February 2018), DFINITY opted to raise a private strategic round, securing $20.5 million in a round led by a16z (the crypto asset investment arm of Andreessen Horowitz) and Polychain Capital.\n\nA few months later, DFINITY airdropped $35 million worth of ICP (then called DFN) tokens to interested users - although the giveaway was only available to non-United States residents.\n\nDFINITY secured a second private fundraise of $97 in August 2018 led once again by a16z and Polychain Capital.",

The current internet is a network that connects everybody and everything, but systems and services run on infrastructure managed by private companies. \n\nThe IC aims to upend this model through the creation of Chain Key Technology, which includes several complementary components like a new consensus model (Threshold Relay), Non-Interactive Distributed Key Generation (NI-DKG), an on-chain governance system (the Network Nervous System or NNS), and decentralized identity (Internet Identity).\n\nChain Key Technology consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that orchestrate the nodes that make up the Internet Computer. It enables the IC to have a single public key, which is small enough (in size) to allow any device, like smartwatches and mobile phones, to verify the authenticity of artifacts from the Internet Computer.\n\nChain Key Technology is the engine that drives the Internet Computer and makes its operation possible. It allows for:\nAdding new nodes to form new subnets to help scale the network\nReplacing faulty or crashed nodes with new ones without stopping\nReviving subnets even if too many nodes within have failed\nUpgrading the Internet Computer Protocol, allowing the network to fix bugs and add new features\n\nThe DFINITY R&D team has also invented a new noninteractive key resharing protocol. Each of the old signers only needs to broadcast a single message to the new signers. To ensure that this is done securely, many concepts from advanced cryptography are utilized, including encryption with forward secrecy and noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs. Because it is noninteractive, the way the key resharing protocol operates is ideal for an asynchronous environment, and the benefits include key preservation. Throughout the lifetime of a subnet, it is known by a single public key, and the other parties on the Internet Computer do not have to keep track of changing public keys.",

It runs within the Internet Computer’s protocols and is able to make these changes without interrupting the network’s operation.\n\nThe NNS works by allowing users to stake ICP governance tokens to create voting neurons. Anyone can create a neuron. Users must give neurons a notice of withdrawal that determines their exploration period when creating them, where the length of the notice period is a configuration known as the “dissolve delay.” The voting power of neurons, and their relative claim to voting rewards, is proportional to the quantity of staked ICP, the length of the configured dissolve delay, and their “age.” Neurons can be made to vote manually, or automatically, by following other neurons in a form of liquid democracy.\n\nNeuron holders are placed in a crypto-economic game, where they are incentivized to vote to adopt/reject proposals or configure neuron follows that lead them to vote automatically in a desirable way, according to what is most likely to drive the value of the Internet Computer network over the long term.",

                        "background_details": "Tezos founded and on-chain governance design\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/person/arthur-breitman\">Arthur Breitman</a> first proposed Tezos in a position paper released in Aug. 2014. He later released a white paper in Sept. 2014 that detailed more specifics about the project. Breitman published both articles under the pseudonym \"L. M Goodman\" akin to Bitcoin's anonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. In the documents, the author stressed Bitcoin's design failed to account for a more inclusive governance process and did not facilitate the creation of new tokens. Breitman and his wife <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/kathleen-breitman\">Kathleen</a>, therefore, designed Tezos as a token issuance and smart contract platform with an <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/on-chain-governance\">on-chain governance</a> model, which would allow XTZ holders to vote on proposed protocol upgrades to avoid forking the network.\n\nIn 2015, the Breitmans established a company called Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), which was responsible for writing the initial code for Tezos. At its core, Tezos is a system designed to formalize proposing, voting for, and implementing changes to the functionality of the network. Once a proposal is submitted, holders of Tezos (XTZ) tokens can vote with a weighting of one vote per token. DLS released the source code in 2016 and used the codebase to launch an alphanet of the Tezos protocol in Feb. 2017, a few months before the Tezos token sale.\n\nTezos initial coin offering (ICO) and Foundation troubles\nThe Tezos <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\">initial coin offering (ICO)</a> launched on July 1, 2017, and the two-week sale managed to raise ~$232 million in Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">$BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">$ETH</a>), exceeding the project's target of $20 million. It was the largest ICO at the time, surpassed by Filecoin's (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/filecoin\">$FIL</a>) ~$257 million token sale a few months later. The newly established Tezos Foundation, led by appointed president Johann Gevers, assumed control of the funds as well as the responsibility to deliver the sold tezzies to ICO contributors. The foundation, which did not include the Breitmans as board members for legal reasons, intended to use a portion of the funds to purchase Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS) from the Breitmans, a move that would transfer control of the Tezos codebase to the foundation.\n\nBefore the sale of DLS could take place, an internal dispute arose between the Breitmans and Gevers, leading to a delay in the distribution of XTZ tokens to investors. In response, angry investors launched several class-action lawsuits targeting Tezos and DLT, adding further delays to the protocol's development and token issuance event. The internal dispute ran its course by mid-Feb. 2018, when Gevers and another involved foundation member left their positions.\n\nMainnet launch\nThe foundation's early troubles caused the development team to miss its initial 2017 launch date. After the resolution, protocol development resumed, enabling the Tezos Foundation to release a betanet in June 2018. Once it completed a testing period on the betanet, the foundation launched the Tezos mainnet in Sept. 2018.\n\nThe launch introduced a new version of a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\">Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)</a> consensus model. Token holders can participate in consensus by locking up their tokens in exchange for the ability to validate blocks. The industry commonly refers to this process as <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/staking'\">staking</a>, but the Tezos community uses the synonymous term \"baking.\" The Tezos design expands on traditional PoS systems by enabling users to \"delegate\" tokens to bakers without transferring ownership. In this self-described \"liquid\" PoS model, a baker receives a block reward in the form of new XTZ tokens with a proportional amount of this reward distributed to users that delegated tokens to the baker. This system enables smaller token holders to participate in the validation (and reward) process if they hold less than the required amount to become a full baker.",

Carthage also aims to improve the accuracy and security of calculating baking rewards (especially concerning endorsement rewards). On the security front, the more robust design could hinder selfish-mining like attacks from non-cooperative bakers, which a former Harvard researcher previously revealed as a possible attack vector on Tezos."

Users can stake XTZ tokens directly on the network to participate in the validation of transactions and blocks.

Bakers and endorsers receive rewards (in the form of XTZ inflation or newly minted tokens) for their contributions to incentivize consensus participation. The delegation process transcends traditional PoS models as anyone is free to participate as well as select and govern the validator of their choice to offload any infrastructure management or costs.\n\nImplicit vs. originated accounts\nOriginated accounts are contracts that can delegate funds to other accounts to participate in the baking process. Implicit accounts cannot delegate; instead, they can be registered as bakers and receive delegate funds (and voting power) Once registered, an implicit account can participate in baking with its own balance plus any funds delegated from originated accounts.",

The developers made a unique choice to use OCaml as the programming language arguing that it offers better security features and is a more powerful interface compared to other options like C++. OCaml also allows developers to check operations using formal verification which can detect potential bugs or errors in the code. \n\nTo allow for future changes to the network Tezos is divided into network, transaction, and consensus protocols. The transaction and consensus protocols operate separately and plug into a generic network shell. This shell maintains the current state of the blockchain and allows the network to conduct internal checks on the protocols allowing them to validate their own replacements. Proposed changes can be made by anyone and are decided on by a vote from token holders. Proposals can include a payment to be made by the developer proposing a change that the team believes will incentive more impactful development on the platform.\n\nTezos uses a variation of a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> system that differs slightly from established models in that block producers are not selected by token holders and anyone can participate as a baker (validator) if they hold a specified amount of tokens. Token holders that do not meet the minimum threshold can delegate their tokens to a baker without needing to relinquish control of their tokens. Using this model the team believes they can increase participation from token holders by reducing frictions and allowing anyone to receive newly released XTZ to maintain the relative value of their holdings.",

In 1997 Yat joined AT&T Solutions' System Integration practice, but left in 1998 to set up Outblaze, which developed innovative web-based multilingual white label communication and collaboration services.\n\nYat Siu's steady leadership and vision steered Outblaze through the Dotcom Bubble and several subsequent crises. Outblaze became a world leader in white label hosted web services, winning numerous awards and accolades. With over 75 million end-users under management, Outblaze secured clients and partners from all over the world and business sectors, including service providers, telecommunications operators, corporations, academia, media and publishing companies.\n\nIn April 2009, Outblaze messaging assets were sold to IBM and incorporated in IBM's LotusLive suite of services. IBM also used the Outblaze assets to open its first cloud computing laboratory in Hong Kong. The transaction established beyond doubt that -like banking and finance services- Hong Kong's local information technology can compete on a global scale.\n\nYat Siu was called World Economic Forum Global Leader of Tomorrow and a Young Global Leader of Tomorrow. He has also been awarded for his contributions in business and society: Standard Chartered Platinum Achievers Award, the URENCO Innovation Award, and, for the execution of his vision at Outblaze, the IT Excellence Product Award, Linux Business Adoption Award 2003 and the Asia Pacific Information &amp; Communication Technologies Award 2003. Most recently he won the Young Entrepeneur Award from the Hong Kong Business Awards 2009.\n\nSpecialties: Internet, messaging, e-mail services, social media, development, video and online gaming industry, new media licensing and brand development",

Creators can spend SAND to acquire ASSETS and LAND. Artists can spend SAND to upload ASSETS to the Marketplace and buy GEMs for defining item rarity.\nGovernance: $SAND allows holders to participate in governance decisions. SAND owners can vote themselves or delegate voting rights to other players of their choice.\nStaking: Users can stake $SAND tokens to earn rewards, as well as GEMs and CATALYSTs for ASSETS creation.\n\nThe Sandbox also utilizes the ERC-721 non-fungible token standard for its LAND – digital land – assets (read the technology section to find out more about The Sandbox's other ecosystem tokens).

                        "technology_details": "The Sandbox platform currently runs exclusively on Ethereum, which is used to record the ownership of tokens and allow owners to transfer, sell, or use them without restrictions. IPFS is used to store all related information of ASSETS, and ensures that this information cannot be changed without the permission from respective owners.The ERC-20 standard is used for the SAND, GEM, and CATALYST tokens, while ERC-1155 and ERC-721 standards are used for the storage and trading of LAND and ASSETS.\n\nThe Sandbox gaming environment will be divided into 5 types of tokens:\nSAND  – the in-game currency used across The Sandbox ecosystem\nLANDS – worlds in which players play that are created by the community\nASSETS – voxel models created by players and traded in the marketplace)\nGEMS – burnt to give attributes to ASSETS. GEMS are ERC20 tokens. \nCATALYSTS –  burnt to mint ASSETS. Depending on their power, they allow users to associate a certain number of GEMS to an ASSET. CATALYSTS are ERC20 tokens\n\nThe Sandbox platform architecture is composed of several components. In terms of blockchain integration, The Sandbox uses a traditional backend running on the cloud (currently using AWS) to support its web frontend. An S3 bucket is used to store the asset of the artist before they get minted. While The Sandbox currently guarantees the privacy of an artist's work (to protect their work from being copied prior to minting), the team envisions that later systems will prevent even The Sandbox from viewing an artist's work pre-minting.\n\nOnce a UGC asset is minted, The Sandbox backend releases the ASSET on IPFS so that it becomes publicly tradeable. The Sandbox smart contract records the hash of every ASSET so that the owner of the ASSET will always be able to prove ownership of not only the number recorded on the blockchain (which many projects in the blockchain gaming space stop there) but also the voxel model and various renders.\n\nThe overall Sandbox architecture and respective components are as follows:\nCreators can create ASSETS with VoxEdit, and upload those ASSETS through the browser\nMetamask – a web3 provider – acts as an intermediary between the users and Ethereum\nA browser in which the user will interact with the smart contracts and our server\nThe smart contracts running on the blockchain\nThe Sandbox server currently hosted on AWS\nThe backend is being developed with Node.js, which manages the creation of an asset on S3, generating a Hash ID for that ASSET, which is sent back to the frontend so it can begin the transaction using the smart contract. \nFinally, once a transaction is confirmed The Sandbox releases the asset on the IPFS network. ensuring that future owner will always be able to prove that what graphical representation they hold is indeed the original one.",

These holders may allocate reserves as they see fit, all of which must be formalized through on-chain governance and SAND voting.\n\nThis direct link between a growing treasury and SAND governance gives token holders a means of directing value across The Sandbox ecosystem, whether directly to those passively staking SAND or through more creative means like curation, committees and usage incentives. Alongside governance, The Sandbox team is building a robust system where those who curate with their SAND will be able to earn and collect fees on top of whatever is routed to the treasury, providing a secondary means of income to active users of the platform.\n\nBoth the Game Makers Fund and Creators Fund are managed by the Foundation, used to support the ecosystem by offering grants to incentivize high quality content and game production in The Sandbox. \n\nTo date, the Foundation has distributed more than 22,800,000 SAND tokens to support the community through the following activities:\nFunding over 17 game projects, some of which have been unveiled to the public. \nDistributing grants to 100 artists to produce NFTs.\nSupporting local community managers to grow awareness around the globe about The Sandbox, NFTs, and blockchain gaming via the Community Rewards and Ambassadors program.\nSponsoring prizes to the various contests organized by The Sandbox team (VoxEdit Contests and Game Jams) to stimulate the creativity of users around the world and get them to engage with the tools of our platform.\nSupporting play-to-earn tournaments and cross-gaming with activities such as the F1 Delta Time prize pool tournament that encourage the broader adoption of SAND.\nSupporting marketing activities contributing to the growth of awareness about NFTs, Metaverse, and $SAND adoption, including co-marketing with Exchanges, Influencers etc such as WazirX SAND Giveaway or SAND Exclusive Campaign or Bitmart Halloween Trick or Treat.",

This ensures security for TUSD, as it gets rid of the need for third parties and instead relies on the security of the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, trading tokens is simple with TUSD because viewing and transferring of PAX is automatically supported by most Ethereum-supporting exchanges and wallet applications.\n\nIn December 2019, TrueUSD added real time auditting, made possible through banking APIs on one end and public blockchain data pulls on the other.",
