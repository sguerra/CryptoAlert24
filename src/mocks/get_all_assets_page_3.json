The platform focuses on the ownership of parcels of digital land where users can create unique environments in a virtual world. Content creators will be able to prove ownership of, and capture value from, their contributions to the platform. Users will be able to traverse unique areas of content, which can be clustered into districts, giving content creators targeted traffic and allow for spatial discovery of new content by users.\n\nCurrently, users gather, interact, share content, and play games primarily on large proprietary platforms like Facebook. The team believes that a decentralized model will allow participants to realize several benefits over current centralized services. Users and contributors will be able to benefit from transactions that occur on the platform, instead of allowing some or all of the revenue to flow to a single party. Furthermore, a decentralized platform will reduce the risk of censorship and vulnerabilities due to infrastructure failures or security breaches.\n\nDecentraland uses two tokens, LAND and MANA, which allow users to interact with the platform. Individual ownership of land parcels are represented by non-fungible LAND tokens containing the coordinates of a single point on the grid and a reference to the details of each parcel. Ownership details are managed through a ledger on a smart contract. To acquire LAND users must burn ERC20 based MANA tokens. MANA tokens are also used for the purchase of in-game goods and services.\n\nIn Dec. 2017, the first LAND tokens representing parcels in the first part of the game, Genesis City, were auctioned off. In March 2018, the Decentraland Marketplace was released allowing users to buy and sell parcels (LAND) in Genesis City as well as explore the area on a map. As of May 2018, the platform was still under development. The team plans to roll out access to the Decentraland world through a variety of devices including mobile, web and virtual reality (VR) platforms.",

Following the sale, a total of 2.81 billion MANA tokens were created. Participants in the token sale received 40% of total supply (1.12 billion MANA) with a discount system that was scheduled to sell 1,000 MANA at a range of $0.024 to $0.04. Due to a small number of large investors the sale was concluded in only 35 seconds.\n\nThe development team, Decentraland Foundation, and a community reserve each received 20% of total supply (561.2 million MANA) with the founder allocation vesting over three years at semi-annual periods.\n\nAdditional MANA tokens will be released on an ongoing basis using a continuous token model. In the first year the supply will increase by 8.00% and this rate decreases over time, to 6.06% by year 5 and 4.65% by year 10. These additional tokens will be sold through a smart contract, at a price that can be updated by the Decentraland Foundation to ensure coherence with the market price of MANA. Proceeds will be used to provide ongoing financing for the Foundation.\n\nOn Dec. 15, 2017 the Genesis City auction, known as the Terraform Event, sold 90,000 parcels (LAND) in the first area of the platform. Of these, 40,000 were used to create designated community districts based on user proposals. These were priced at 1,000 MANA per LAND. The remaining supply of parcels was auctioned at the same starting rate with the requirement that each bid be 25.00% larger than the last resulting in some parcels selling for 80,000 MANA.",

Each LAND entry also contains a has that references the file containing the details of each parcel of land. \n\nFiles related to LAND entries are contained in the content layer which stores specific details of a land parcel, such descriptions of objects, textures, sounds, as well as scripts controlling how the content is placed and behaves in the parcel. Additional details such as scripts for user interaction and a link to servers for peer-to-peer interactions can be stored in these files. The platform uses IPFS network to store data and links in the consensus layer to retrieve it.\n\nUsers will interact with objects and other participants in the virtual world through the real-time layer. All interactions on this layer will be handled through peer-to-peer connections, with servers hosted by landowners or third-parties, removing the need to rely on centralized servers. \n\nThe team has released a software development kit (SDK) that will allow developers to create content within Genesis City and continues to work on integrations for identity and a payment channel infrastructure to facilitate micro-payments on the platform.

            "background_details": "Axie was built as a fun and educational way to introduce the world to blockchain technology. Many of the original team members met playing Cryptokitties, and it was their first time ever using blockchain for non-trading activities. Axie Infinity differs from a typical game because it leverages blockchain incentives to reward players economically for their contributions to the ecosystem. This mechanism, dubbed \"Play-to-Earn\", has grown increasingly popular in developing nations like the Philippines, Argentina, and Venezuela. In some of these places, the economic opportunities present in-game exceed those available in the real world. \n\nAxie has served as the on-ramp into crypto for many thousands of users. As of July 2021, the Axie counts 568K Discord Users and 450K Daily Average Users (DAUs) of the game itself. Axie Infinity collects revenues comparable to those of other DeFi Protocols. Axie has generated a venerable internal economy, especially relative to other blockchain virtual worlds like Decentraland, SomniumSpace, Cryptovoxels, and Sandbox. In fact, because the barrier to entry is high for players to begin earning, a banking layer has taken form in Yield Guild. This \"NFT bank\" rents Axies to scholars who don't have sufficient capital to kick off their Axie journey. \n\nAxie's creators identified and set out to remedy a fundamental flaw in the Web2 gaming model: the value generated in games like Fortnite accrued solely to the platform owners. Web2 in-game assets were merely rented from the platform, not owned by users or freely tradeable. These assets could be easily be wiped if an account were banned. This hamstrung the potential value embedded in virtual worlds and disempowered users. Axie hands the keys of the virtual world to the users, allowing them to modify the digital topography and maintain full sovereignty over their arithmetically scarce assets.",

Both staking and governance are limited currently, but will be integrated as per the roadmap. $AXS serves secondarily as legal tender in the Axie marketplace, where in-game NFTs may be purchased. Finally, $AXS acts as work token in that it is spent, along with $SLP (discussed below) in order to breed new Axies. Breeding fees are currently 4 $AXS and are directed to the treasury. The treasury will at some point be governed by the community of $AXS holders.\n\n$AXS is an ERC-20 token, meaning that users with Ethereum wallets can freely buy and sell it. It can be acquired or sold on a variety of marketplaces, including Binance and Uniswap. \n\nAxie Infinity actually uses a dual-token structure. Smooth Love Potion ($SLP) is the other in-game fungible ERC-20 token. SLP is burned to enable Axies to breed and create new Axies. Axie Infinity utilizes a burn algorithm that adjusts the Axie breeding costs, denominated in $SLP, upwards overtime, introducing scarcity. $SLP is rewarded to players who've won battles or participated in adventure mode, hence the \"play-to-earn\" descriptor.

            "technology_details": "Axie Infinity is a distributed application that is currently running on the Ethereum Network, Loom Network and Ronin Network, using bespoke smart contracts to enable users to own, transfer, battle, and breed genetically unique digital creatures. Sky Mavis has embedded economic incentives in Axie infinity by leveraging Ethereum token standards ERC-20 and ERC-721. All unique in-game assets are represented by ERC-721 NFTs that live in users' wallets. In-game currencies SLP and AXS are fungible ERC-20 tokens. Axie combines the \"digital property rights\" that NFTs enable with algorithmic scarcity. Axies have finite breeding caps and the algorithm will adjust upwards the cost of breeding, denominated in SLP, as the user base grows. \n\nTo account for scale in adoption and transactions, Sky Mavis created a purpose-built side chain called Ronin. The full Ronin migration was executed by mid-2021. Ronin permits for higher transaction throughput and lower gas fees for users. The Sky Mavis team also built out a simplified Ronin Wallet for smoother onboarding. Despite building out Ronin for transaction scaling, the explosion in Daily Average Users (450K during July 2021) overwhelmed servers, disrupting gameplay. As of July 2021, consensus on Ronin is reached via Proof of Authority. The Sky Mavis team plans to decentralize consensus via permitting community involvement. In an AMA on June 30, 2020 the Sky Mavis CEO Trung Ngyugen explained that the team may consider Delegated Proof of Stake (dPos). \n\nSimilar to Roblux or Minecraft, Axie Infinity sacrifices a high-fidelity, realistic gaming experience for a smooth, unsharded user experience. The decision to keep graphics relatively crude enables individuals with commodity hardware to run the game enjoyably. Part of Axie's explosive adoption is due to mobile use in developing nations. ",

These proposals will initially focus on which teams to continue funding via the community treasury. As of July 2021, the staking/governance functionality has not yet been shipped. In early 2022, the governance proposals become more granular and AXS holders can affect a broader range of outcomes.\n\nSince inception, Axie Infinity has generated hundreds of millions in NFT sales. Without considering breeding fees, this translates to $25MM (4.25% marketplace fee) of assets in the treasury. According to a July 19, 2021 article in DeCrypt, Axie had generated $84,900,000 in treasury funds in the prior week. Researchers will need to track governance tightly, as the governable pot (probably hundreds of millions) is growing rapidly. ",

The project competes with other popular smart contract platforms such as Ethereum (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">$ETH</a>), NEO (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/neo\">$NEO</a>), and Cardano (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/cardano\">$ADA</a>). EOS tries to differentiate itself by providing transaction throughput capable of handling thousands of transactions per second without having to pay direct fees, improved usability for all parties involved, and governance for business and chain maintenance.\n\nEOS makes use of <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/on-chain-governance\">on-chain governance</a> whereby token holders can vote for the block producers (BPs) as well as various upgrades to the protocol, monetary policy, or stakeholder bylaws. The EOS User Agreement defines and enforces the user bylaws. The rules are not enforceable at the protocol level but rather act as a terms-of-service agreement that users must agree to. This community developed agreement replaced Block.one's Constitution by a majority BP vote back in April 2019.\n\nEcosystem funds play an important role in the growth and adoption of EOS. Their mandate is to make strategic investments that increase the value of the projects and tokens to ensure the necessary infrastructure is built and proper incentivization exists to attract developers to build on the platform. The most prominent is a $325 million fund ran by <a href=\"https://messari.io/person/michael-novogratz\">Mike Novogratz</a> called Galaxy Digital EOS VC.",

While BPs must share a smaller piece of the total reward pool, there are only 21 BPs; thus, they receive more daily EOS rewards on average than their counterparts. Standby Producers represent potential block producers ranked outside of the top 21 that have enough voting support from token holders to receive a minimum daily reward of 100 EOS.\n\nHistoric supply and inflation changes\nAt launch, the inflation rate for EOS was 5%, but this metric was somewhat misleading as the network routed 4% of newly minted tokens into the eosio.saving account. The supply directed to this account was illiquid and only accessible by way of a successful vote among the network's 21 block producers (BPs). The rest of the outstanding inflation went to BPs and Standby Producers per the same percentage breakdown described above.\n\nBPs can also vote on decreasing or increasing the inflation rate. Therefore, these network representatives can impact the future supply of EOS by altering the block reward or changing the contents of the eosio.saving account, an act that has happened twice since inception.\n\nOn May 8, 2019, BPs opted to burn all of the tokens collected in the eosio.saving account up until that point, which amounted to 34 million EOS. The inflation rate remained intact, however, so that account continued to accrue 80% of the newly issued (but still illiquid) EOS supply.\n\nIn Feb. 2020, fifteen of the twenty-one BPs voted again to burn the over 34 million EOS tokens (worth almost $140 million at the time) held in the eosio.saving account. This vote also reduced the inflation rate of the network from 5% to its current rate of 1%. This inflation reduction only eliminated the 80% of block rewards previously dedicated to the eosio.saving account, effectively eliminating the role of that account on the network. Since the contents of the eosio.saving account were already illiquid, the vote's impact on the circulating supply and real inflation rate was minimal.\n\nBlock.one vesting schedule\nBlock.one allocated itself 100 million EOS tokens at launch to fund future ecosystem development. These tokens will unlock linearly every second over a period of ten years starting from the network's Genesis Block on Jun. 6, 2018. In May 2019, Block.one claimed a vested batch of 9.8 million EOS and used 3.3 million of these tokens (worth ~$25 million at the time) to purchase network RAM. The firm now only holds the current and future rights to 96.7 million EOS tokens.\n\nImpact of the eosio.ramfee account\nUntil May 1, 2019, and the launch of Resource Exchange (REX) on EOS Mainnet, the fees collected from RAM trading (0.5% of the value of each trade) were sent and stored on the eosio.ramfee account.  From May 1, 2019, the fees are now directly transferred from the eosio.ramfee to the REX, but the funds (approximately 2M EOS) that were located in the eosio.ramfee account before the upgrade will not be allocated to the REX and remain illiquid. \n\nBlacklisted accounts\nEOSIO also has a feature that allows Block Producers to blacklist accounts. All the Block Producers need to blacklist an account in order for the blacklist to happen. Those blacklisted accounts' supply is considered illiquid since it is no longer transferable.  ",

Beyond its delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, EOS employs Graphene technology and (in the long-term) parallel processing to maximize performance.\nGraphene technology: An open-course software toolkit developed by Dan Larimer that helps improve transaction processing capabilities. It is currently used by previous Larimer creations, Bitshares and Steem, as well as MUSE and Peerplay.\nParallel computation: Also referred to as horizontal scaling, this technology divides transactions and smart contract execution among multiple processors to help reduce the run time of a program. The first protocol version will operate on a single thread (i.e., a single processor) but will shift to a multithreaded platform in the future.\n\nEOS requires users to obtain the following resources to submit transactions and run decentralized applications:\nCPU: the processing power it takes to operate a dApp and read data from a storage device (measured in microseconds)\nNET: network bandwidth or the average rate of data transfer through the communication protocol (measured in bytes)\nRAM: data storage\n\nEOS holders receive CPU and NET by staking their tokens and receiving a proportional amount of the network resources. As a result, the network utilizes a no direct fee model where tokens give holders access to their pro-rata share of network resources. That being said, any operation needing storage or to create an account requires RAM to be purchased separately.\n\nEOS uses the WebAssembly Virtual Machine (WASM), which offers high speed and performance as well as support for a multitude of programming languages such as C, C++, and Rust, giving developers access to existing optimization and debugging tools.\n\nAdditionally, EOS implements human-readable names and account recovery solutions at the protocol level. Recovery is made possible with the designation of a recovery party that can reset the owner's keys with their approval. Unlike traditional multi-signature applications, the recovery partner has no control over the account other than helping the owner reset their keys.",

Similar to how EOS stakeholders vote on block producers, this model allows token holders to vote on protocol decisions that are automatically implemented or rejected depending on the final vote tally. Votes are weighted by the number of tokens held, and holders can opt to delegate their votes to another holder on their behalf. Protocol decisions can consist of changes to the system parameters, updates to the User Agreement, or alterations on the inflation rate, among others.\n\n__EOS Constitution replaced for the new User Agreement__\nBlock.one initially instituted a [Constitution](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/5068823fbc8a8f7d29733309c0496438c339f7dc/constitution.md) (now outdated) for the protocol, which consisted of various articles defining how users, developers, and validators should act on-chain. It served [as the](https://multicoin.capital/2018/04/24/eos-analysis-and-valuation/) \"terms of service agreement in the software that bound stakeholders together through a set of bylaws.\" While well-intentioned, the Constitutional ran into some early roadblocks. Dan Larimer even proposed a new version that looked to remove the Arbitration Forum/establishment of the block producers as the jury and implement a supermajority vote required to freeze any account or contract, among other clarifications.\n\nDespite Larimer's contribution, the community opted to develop its own solution, resulting in an open-source governance framework dubbed the EOS User Agreement. BPs [approved](https://steemit.com/eos/@lukestokes/the-eos-user-agreement-is-live) the User Agreement by a majority vote (15/21), and the agreement officially replaced the old Constitution in April 2019.\n\nLearn more about the User Agreement and its eleven articles [here](https://github.com/eosnewyork/eosuseragreement/blob/master/README.md)\n\n__Governance Resources__\n[EOS Titan Voting Dashboard](https://eostitan.com/proposals?showExpired=false)\n[EOS Authority Voting Dashboard](https://eosauthority.com/polls?network=eos)",

Theta Network launched its own mainnet 1.0 in March, 2019. \n\nWith Mainnet 2.0 in May 2020, they introduced Guardian nodes, a two-layer consensus mechanism to complement its Enterprise validators run by partners including Google, Samsung, Binance, Blockchain.com, and Gumi.\n\nWith Mainnet 2.0, the capability of the Theta Edge Node network was enhanced with the release of Theta’s peer-to-peer “EdgeCast” technology. This fully decentralized technology stack adds the ability to capture live video, transcode it in real-time, cache and relay live stream video data to users globally. The project claims an edge network run by thousands of community members, without central servers or services. \n\nIn July 2021, Theta launched Mainnet 3.0. Adding a smart contract capability, the project hopes to significantly increase the engagement and retention of platform users. For example, leveraging smart contracts on the Theta network could enable fully digitized item ownership, innovative payment-consumption models, transparent royalty distributions, trustless crowdfunding mechanisms, etc. This provides an additional layer of social and economic interactivity that supplements the core functionality of video and data delivery.",

In addition, video platforms may purchase TFuel in order to incorporate Theta P2P video delivery protocol into their infrastructure, reward their end-users for sharing bandwidth and as a payment method to content creators.\n\nIn Mainnet 3.0, the protocol also rewards Theta edge nodes, another important network participant responsible for providing video delivery services as shown in Diagram 2. Enhanced economics include new TFuel inflation, staking and burning."

The Theta blockchain also introduces a multi-level Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism which aims to provide the same network security as Bitcoin or Ethereum with much higher transactions per second validated. \n\nTheta Mainnet\n\nTheta's multi-level BFT designs for a small set of nodes called a validator committee to produce a chain of blocks as fast as possible while the thousands of other network participants, called guardians, can check this chain's validity. Guardians are a superset of the validator committee. Valid blocks require two-thirds of Theta guardians to validate. Theta Tokens were initially distributed as ERC-20 compliant tokens on Ethereum but later were exchanged one-to-one for native Theta Network tokens. The Theta Network mainnet launched on March 15, 2019.  \n\nTheta P2P Network\n\nWith Mainnet 2, Theta released peer-to-peer “EdgeCast” technology. This decentralized technology stack adds the ability to capture live video, transcode it in real-time, cache and relay live stream video data to users globally. According to the project's vision, all this would happen without central servers, in other words decentralizing video distribution end-to-end.\n\nTheta TV\n\nTheta TV is the main materialization of Theta's vision of streaming video using a peer-to-peer network. Its brand tagline is \"Esports Entertainment Platform\". Content creators can earn Tfuel from viewer donations, a Tfuel pool paying out according to hours watched, viewer subscriptions. Content creators can also solicit donations from their viewers using credit cards, paid out in USD stablecoin to the creator's wallet. Viewership seems to be limited to below 1000 at any one time. \n\nThetadrop NFT\n\nIn June 2021, Theta introduced a new product, Thetadrop. It is a marketplace for NFTs minted on the Theta network, traded in USD or TFuel. Advertised NFT include 3D animations from community artists, World Poker Tour \"Moments\", Theta-themed collectibles, and the like.\n\nContrary to popular NFT platforms like OpenSea, the NFTs purchased don't end up in the user's own wallet, just an address associated with that wallet. (Project is still in beta).\n",

There is no known way for Theta token holders to make proposals, inspect proposals, or otherwise participate in a governance process. The Theta team controls all funds in the reserve and has full discretion on how to allocate those tokens in the future.\n\n",

The protocol provides the option for transactions to be either shielded, in which case they will be completely anonymous, or transparent, in which case they will be visible on the Zcash blockchain. Zcash pays out a portion of its block rewards, called the \"Founder's Reward\", to fund protocol development. It currently allocates the Founder's Reward to the Electric Coin Company and the Zcash Foundation who develop and steward the Zcash protocol respectively.",

            "background_details": "Created in 2013, Zcash, previously known as “Zerocoin”, was initially suggested as an experimental privacy extension to Bitcoin using advanced mathematical techniques called \"zero-knowledge proofs\". Due to the Zerocoin protocol's novelty and computational intensity, however, Bitcoin core developers deemed it impractical for implementation into the Bitcoin protocol. Subsequently, with additional improvements to the protocol that resulted in substantially more efficient zero knowledge proofs, Zerocoin's founding scientists from John Hopkins in collaboration with researchers from MIT and Tel Aviv University created a new protocol called \"Zerocash\" (Zcash). Upon recruiting it's CEO, Zooko Wilcox, to head the project and raising over $3mm in venture funding through two fundraises, the Zcash protocol began development under the Zcash Company, with the objective of building the Zcash protocol into a full-fledged cryptocurrency. In 2017, a separate entity, the Zcash Foundation was incorporated as a 501(c)3 nonprofit with the mission to build internet payment and privacy infrastructure for the public good, primarily serving the users of the Zcash protocol and blockchain  In 2019, the Zcash Company rebranded to the Electric Coin Company.\n\nZcash was conceived from the observation that Bitcoin could not offer strong privacy guarantees, with transactions recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which significant information can be deduced. At the core of Zcash technology are zero-knowledge proofs, which allow transaction data to be validated without revealing information about the amount and the parties involved. With Zcash users can selectively share address and transaction information for auditing or regulatory compliance through the use of view keys and payment disclosure. Through the use of zero-knowledge proofs, Zcash aims to create a truly fungible, privacy preserving cryptocurrency.\n\nZcash is built on strong science and audited by third parties. It is an open-source protocol, built by a security-specialized engineering team, and originally based on Bitcoin Core's codebase.",

DCG also owns and operates CoinDesk, a well-known media company in the space, Genesis Trading, a bitcoin brokerage firm, and Grayscale Investments, a digital currency asset management firm. DCG has made over 100 investments in the space including well-known startups like Protocol Labs, Coinbase, and Ripple."

These were the initial distribution intentions, but they are likely to mix between these two buckets.\n\nZcash also featured a slow start at the launch of the network: for the first 20,000 blocks, the number of ZEC mined per block grew linearly from 0 toward 12.5. Thus the 20,000th block was the first block with a 12.5 ZEC block reward. "

            "technology_details": "Zcash, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of unspent transaction output (UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of 2MB data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (mempool) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Zcash's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Zcash uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain’s work\n\nIn order to have zero-knowledge privacy in Zcash, the function determining the validity of a transaction according to the network’s consensus rules must return the answer of whether the transaction is valid or not, without revealing any of the information it performed the calculations on. This is done by encoding some of the network’s consensus rules in zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge). Zk-SNARKs are specific zero-knowledge proofs whereby one can prove possession of certain information, e.g. a secret key, without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier. \n\nZcash addresses are either private (z-addresses) or transparent (t-addresses). Z-addresses start with a “z,” and t-addresses start with a \"t.\" The two Zcash address types are interoperable, and funds can be transferred between z-addresses and t-addresses. A Z-to-Z transaction appears on the public blockchain, so it is known to have occurred and that the fees were paid. But the addresses, transaction amount and the memo field are all encrypted and not publicly visible. Transactions between two transparent addresses (t-addresses) work just like Bitcoin: The sender, receiver and transaction value are publicly visible. The owner of an address may choose to disclose z-address and transaction details with trusted third parties using view keys and payment disclosure. \n",

          "governance_details": "Zcash is an open source community; historically most protocol development is largely handled by The Electric Coin Company. The Electric Coin Company maintains “zcashd,” the only production-ready node implementation. Protocol development is governed by the Zcash Improvement Proposal process (ZIP) whereby anyone in the open source Zcash community can submit draft ZIPs. After discussion by the Zcash community, the ZIP editors, features are selected for the upcoming network upgrade. Daira Hopwood, Principal Engineer of the Electric Coin Company and George Tankersley, Director of Engineering of the Zcash Foundation, accept or reject the ZIPs. Decisions from the ZIP process are written into the Zcash specification, as well as the software that runs the network. Finally, protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.\n\nThe Electric Coin Company and the Zcash Foundation are the two organizations who receive an allocation of the founder’s reward every block until the 850,000th block is mined at which point they will have cumulatively received 10% of the 21 million ZEC that will ever be mined. The Electric Coin Company is a for-profit organization that launched and supports the Zcash protocol. The Zcash foundation is a 501(c)3 public charity, dedicated to building internet payment and privacy infrastructure for the public good. Moving forward the Zcash foundation plans further decentralize the Zcash project through promoting competing node implementations, increasing community involvement, and ultimately reducing the influence of both itself and the Electric Coin Company on the Zcash protocol. Meaningful steps to this end include the Electric Coin Company donating the Zcash trademark to Zcash Foundation and the Development Fund discussion that is currently underway and will go into effect in October 2020",

What made it different at the time of launch was that PancakeSwap was built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum. At the time of PancakeSwap's launch, Ethereum was suffering from expensive and slow transactions as DeFi's mainstream moment in 2020 drove massive demand for transactions. Almost all DeFi applications lived on Ethereum at the time.\n\nAside from cheaper network fees powered by BSC, PancakeSwap also offered a lower swap fee of 0.2% while the industry standard is 0.3%. On the back of its low-fee model, PancakeSwap saw rapid growth in both trading volume and total value locked (TVL). It became one of the industry's largest decentralized exchanges by trading volume in February 2021, standing toe-to-toe with AMM pioneer and Ethereum darling Uniswap.\n\nTowards a Diversified DeFi Institution\nThanks to cheaper network fees, strong branding, and the delivery of new and innovative features, PancakeSwap has experienced a meteoric rise in total value locked (TVL) in 2021.  PancakeSwap plans to expand its purview into prediction markets, lending and borrowing, and margin trading. ",

            "technology_details": "PancakeSwap is a protocol that facilitates the exchange of BEP-20 tokens. Typically, centralized exchanges function by using an order-book where market participants post limit orders at which they are willing to buy and sell an asset, and market makers fill these orders with the intention of earning a return on the spread. PancakeSwap does away entirely with the order book and instead opts to have liquidity providers deposit assets into a pool that traders can then trade against. The price is determined algorithmically based on the proportion of the two assets being traded.\n\nPrice Mechanism\nPancakeSwap uses what's known as a Constant Product Market Maker that is designed to always provide liquidity regardless of the order size or amount of funds in the pool. This is achieved by asymptotically increasing the price as the size of the buy order increases, leading to potentially significant slippage on large orders. Trading pools consist of two tokens, with the product between the two sums remaining constant. Any given transaction increases one sum while decreasing the other and the price changes based on the ratio between the two. \n\nProviding Liquidity\nWhen liquidity providers add to a pool, they receive newly minted liquidity provider (LP) tokens entitling them to their proportion of the total pool as well as the 0.17% fee generated off each trade. PancakeSwap Treasury receives the remaining 0.03% from the 0.20% charged on every trade. Liquidity tokens keep track of how much of the pool is owed. Liquidity providers need to supply both assets in the same proportion they are currently at, otherwise, they will change the ratio and thus price. This would result in the immediate loss of money as the price change should get arbitraged out by trading bots. Even if providers supply the correct ratio of each asset, large price changes can result in the loss of money, also known as impermanent loss. Therefore, providers are hoping for substantial volume of trading around the price they entered such that the fees generated account for any potential losses.",

            "background_details": "The Maker protocol is an open-source project started in 2014 with the goal of creating a permissionless credit system that would allow users to take out loans collateralized by cryptocurrency. These loans are created by smart contracts that mint <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dai\">Dai</a>, a stablecoin with a soft peg to the US dollar. The protocol was built by the Maker Foundation along with a number of outside parties and over time the foundation has worked to reduce its level of control. They have gradually ceded control to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) known as MakerDAO which governs the protocol. The DAO is comprised of individuals across the globe that own the MKR token which affords holders the right to vote on important changes.\n\nSingle Collateral Dai\nThe first iteration was known as Single Collateral Dai (SCD) because Ethereum was the only asset used as collateral to take out a loan. It launched in December 2017 and grew to support $100 million worth of debt. Despite a 94% decrease in the value of collateral over that time, the system remained healthy and Dai maintained a close peg to $1. Since Dai was the only widespread stablecoin that did not require a company to back it by holding US dollars, it became an integral piece of the growing decentralized finance ecosystem. While SCD proved to be effective, the intended goal was to transition to Multi Collateral Dai (MCD) that could accept collateral other than Dai as well as implement other key design changes.\n\nTransition to Multi Collateral Dai\nIn November 2019 MakerDAO <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/multi-collateral-dai-is-live\">upgraded</a> the protocol to MCD with Basic Attention Token (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bat\">BAT</a>) being voted as the first additional collateral available. The existing single collateral system continues to function as is while users are encouraged to migrate to the new Dai. Eventually, the single collateral system will be phased out altogether. In addition to the new collateral, MCD made other important design changes such as the introduction of the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) which allows Dai holders to earn yield and collateral auctions that create a competitive market for liquidations.\n\nInternal controversy\nTowards the end of 2018, the Maker Ecosystem Growth Fund (MEGF) was established to oversee the treasury of MKR tokens by nine board members chosen by the CEO Rune Christensen. According to a document from the former CTO Andy Milenius, titled ”Zandy’s Story”, after some disagreements as to how the fund was to be allocated, Rune presented two divergent choices. The “red pill” was for those who would follow his lead and focus on government compliance and integration into the existing financial system while the blue pill for those who didn’t want a formal organizational structure and would work on MCD and then cease to be funded. However, there was one group that wanted to explore alternative options that called themselves the Purple Pill. When this group was discovered it was seen as conspiratorial and five members of the board that were members of the Purple Pill group were subsequently fired. Those members then sent a legal letter stating they were wrongfully terminated.",

Tokens with these characteristics are commonly referred to as <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/stablecoins\">stablecoins</a>.\n\nThe MKR token is used for governance of the platform allowing holders to vote on various parameters such as the stability fee, debt ceiling, types of collateral to be used, Dai Savings Rate and more. MKR is also used to purchase excess Dai from collateral auctions and stability fee payments in the Surplus Auction. Once the auction is ended the protocol automatically burns the MKR leading to a decreasing supply. However, if there is a shortfall of Dai resulting from loans becoming undercollateralized, a Debt Auction will occur to raise more Dai by printing MKR, thereby increasing the supply. "

            "technology_details": "Vaults (formerly “collateralized debt positions - CDPs)\nThe key component of the Maker protocol and method with which Dai is created is known as a Vault. A Vault is created by depositing collateral into a smart contract which then mints an amount of Dai specified by the user. The dollar value of the collateral must be greater than 150% the value of Dai (current Collateralization Ratio). The user can transact freely with their Dai. If they want to receive their initial collateral they must pay back both the Dai they withdrew plus the interest rate on the loan (Stability Fee). If at any point, the value of the collateral drops below the collateralization ratio, then their position is subject to liquidations where anyone can come in and purchase the underlying collateral to repay the debt. Known as Keepers, these actors are motivated by the profit opportunity from buying the collateral below market price and then selling on the open market.\n\nAuctions\nThere are three types of auctions\nSurplus Auctions occur when loans remain overcollateralized and payments from stability fees reach a certain amount. After that, Dai is auctioned off to Keepers for MKR which is then subsequently destroyed.\nCollateral Auctions occur when Vaults drop below the Collateralization Ratio. The collateral in the vault is then sold until the outstanding debt is repaid plus a liquidation penalty. At that point, the auction becomes a reverse auction, where a bidder bids on accepting smaller parts of collateral for that fixed amount of Dai. Once the process ends, the remaining collateral is returned to the vault owner.\nDebt Auctions occur in the worst-case scenario when the price of collateral drops precipitously such that it can no longer cover the entire debt paid. The system will first look towards the surplus from Stability Fees to cover the debt. If that is not sufficient, a reverse auction occurs to cover the fixed amount of Dai necessary to make the system whole. Bidders compete on willingness to accept decreasing amounts of MKR for the shortfall in Dai.\n\nDai Savings Rate (DSR)\nThe DSR was implemented in MCD as a way for Dai holders to earn interest on their holdings. Users can deposit Dai into a non-custodial smart contract and immediately begin earning interest funded by Stability Fee payments. They are also free to withdraw at any time. The DSR serves as a monetary policy tool for governance to control the outstanding supply of Dai in order to manage the $1 peg. If the peg were to drop below $1, MKR holders could vote to increase the DSR. This would incentivize Dai holders to lock more Dai up, decreasing the supply and ideally bringing the price back up.",

Anyone is free to submit a proposal which then goes through a Governance Poll to establish rough community consensus. Polls can be proactive to account for one-off or intermittent issues that need to be addressed for future issues, or they can be reactive to respond to a present state change. Once there is general agreement, the issue is put up for an Executive Vote where MKR holders vote to enact the change.\n\nExamples of changes that can be made include:\nNew collateral types with their own unique risk parameters such as Collateralization Ratio and debt ceiling\nSelection of oracle feeds to input the market price of various collateral assets\nModifications to the Stability Fee or Dai Savings Rate\nAllocations of funds from the Maker Buffer which include the totally system’s revenues from Liquidation and Stability Fees\nTriggering Emergency Shutdown\n\nEmergency Shutdown\nA critical component of Maker governance is the Emergency Shutdown capability. It serves two functions: to shutdown the old system in the event of a major upgrade as we will see with single collateral Dai, or as a last resort mechanism in the event of any malicious governance activity, attack or security breach. Once 50,000 MKR are placed in the Emergency Shutdown Module, it is enacted immediately to shut down the system and return collateral to Dai holders and Vault owners. Vault owners can withdraw their collateral minus the Dai debt owed which is then available for Dai holders through the main collateral claim process. This is a manual process where Dai holders use Dai to claim collateral at a fixed rate corresponding to the calculated value based on the Dai Target Price. In receiving their proportional claim of the collateral portfolio they could be at risk of a haircut due to the risk in decline of collateral value.\n\nGovernance Security Module (GSM)\nAfter an Executive Vote gets passed, there is a 24-hour delay period before the change gets deployed to give stakeholders time to review the code and maintain the integrity of the system. If they believe the change is detrimental to the system, MKR holders can opt for an Emergency Shutdown so that all stakeholders receive their fair value currently locked in the system.\n\nMakerDAO hosts weekly governance calls on Thursdays 4pm UTC",

            "technology_details": "Aave’s shifted from a decentralized P2P lending strategy (direct loan relationship between lenders and borrowers, like in ETHLend) to a pool-based strategy. Lenders provide liquidity by depositing cryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by placing collateral. Loans do not need to be individually matched, instead, they rely on the pooled funds, as well as the amounts borrowed and their collateral. This enables instant loans with characteristics based on the state of the pool.\n\nFlash Loans\nAave also allows loans to be taken out without any collateral by creating logic that if it's not repaid within the block time, the transaction gets reversed. These flash loans are designed to be used by developers to build tools that require capital for arbitrage, refinancing or liquidating purposes. An example would be if a user took out a loan on <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/maker\">Maker</a> and the collateral price dropped making it close to liquidation, they could use a flash loan to repay the Maker loan and receive their collateral back. They could then sell the collateral to repay the flash loan thus avoiding the liquidation penalty on Maker without ever needing to actually have the funds necessary for repayment.\n\nRate Switching\nAnother unique feature of Aave is that it allows borrowers to switch between fixed and floating interest rates. Interest rates in DeFi are traditionally volatile making it difficult to estimate the long-term cost of borrowing. If a user anticipates interest rates to rise they can switch their loan to fixed rate in order to lock in their borrowing costs for the future, and if they expect rates to decrease they can switch back to floating to then decrease their borrowing costs. There are two exceptions where the fixed rate can actually change and that is if the deposit earning rate increases above the fixed borrow rate because the system could get unstable by paying out more than its being paid. In that case, the fixed rate is rebalanced to the new stable rate. the other scenario which works in the borrower's favor is if the variable rate is lower than the fixed rate by 20%, the loan will automatically decrease to account for the difference. \n",

The long-term goal of the team is to transition to a fully decentralized exchange model. \n\nCurrently, the exchange operates through more of a centralized model, attempting to duplicate best practices in traditional asset exchanges including dedicated risk and compliance teams. These teams are responsible for internal controls and cross-departmental reviews aimed at reducing fraudulent activity on the platform.\n\nKuCoin Shares (KCS) is a token used to reward users and attract new customers to the exchange. Users holding a specified amount of KCS in their account are eligible for discounts on trading fees. Furthermore, holders of KCS receive a daily dividend, called a KuCoin bonus, equal to 50% of trading fees on the exchange. Those that have referred new users to the platform are eligible to receive 40% of fees while the exchange retains the remaining 10%. Dividends are paid in whichever token was the most traded during the day.\n\nTo encourage referrals, each user receives a registration link they can share. Referral bonuses are paid for both direct and indirect activity. Users receive bonuses for both the activity of their direct referrals as well as the activity from any new users their referrals add to the platform. Users holding enough KCS in their exchange account receive a discount on trading fees. KCS held off-exchange is not eligible for this rebate program. Additional benefits such as a personal investment consultation and expedited customer service are offered to users on a tiered basis as they increase their KCS holdings.\n\nWhile trading rebates and referrals are the current use case for KCS KuCoin plans to use the token for transaction fees once they launch a fully decentralized platform. Current trading fees on the exchange are 0.1% at the time of this report.",

To minimize the chances for disruptions the operations team is split between two sites in Hong Kong and Singapore. Three data centers are maintained with overlapping functionality so operations for the entire business can be run using any of the centers.\n\nThe trading system is designed to handle high trading volumes, up to one million orders per second, through desktop and mobile interfaces.\n\nKuCoin uses multiple wallets with varying levels of security based on the time frame for transactions. Micro-transactions are supported through a multi-firewall private network built on Amazon Web Services. KuCoin employees are provided with a unique cipher code to initiate withdrawals from the wallet. Longer term holdings are stored in bank custody with multiple signatures via independent private keys required to access them.\n\nWithdrawal requests are first inspected using an internal artificial intelligence algorithm designed to process transactions instantly while still maintaining risk and security measures. KuCoin also offers multifactor authentication for transactions. \n\nKuCoin hopes to release a feature whereby exchange participants can self-register new cryptocurrency pairs and start trading automatically to help reach the goal of having 1,000 tokens listed and a daily exchange volume exceeding 100,000 BTC by December 2018. \n\nTokens that fail to meet ongoing listing standards are not immediately delisted on the exchange but are instead put under special treatment rules. Projects may fall under this classification if they are likely to cease activities during the next three months, fail to have enough volume to make markets, appear insolvent, fail an audit, fail to report details in a timely fashion, engage in malicious market activities, dissolve the founding team, or any other reason at the discretion of KuCoin. \n\nProjects in special treatment are designated as such on the platform, so exchange participants are aware the associated token is a candidate for delisting. \n\nAt the end of the observation, period tokens are delisted if they continue not to meet the volume required for listing or the project does not take the necessary actions to remedy the reason special treatment was applied. Alternatively, if a project passes the review, it is restored to the platform in good standing, and the special treatment designation is removed.",

For those holding more than 100,000 HT, an additional 35% is deducted from the fee rate.\n\nHuobi Prime tickets\nHuobi Prime is the company’s IEO platform than enables direct token offerings. They were designed to allow retail investors to invest in primary sales while limiting the purchase of tokens to an equivalent of $1,000 for early investors. Once the token sale is completed, they will be immediately tradeable against HT on the exchange. Huobi Prime listings occur in three rounds with larger discounts typically given in the earlier rounds. Participation typically requires a minimum average monthly HT and the trading quota is based on a tiered system of HT holdings. Once ticket sales are complete, the HT received are subsequently burnt.\n\nFastTrack voting\nEvery month, five projects are announced and then voted on by the community for listing on Huobi’s exchange. The project with the highest number of votes will be listed, while the others go towards the next week’s voting. Users that voted for the winning project are eligible to purchase tokens at a discounted value. All profits from FastTrack are used to repurchase HT that is subsequently burned."

            "technology_details": "Paxos Standard is fully collateralized 1:1 with USD in bank accounts, meaning that the total supply of Paxos (PAX) is backed by a fiat held in reserve by Paxos. The requests for purchase and redemption of PAX results in movement of cash in and out of the reserve, which in turn has the supplyController address mint and burn tokens accordingly. For example, purchase of $100 will result in issuance of 100 PAX tokens and $100 being deposited into the reserve. On the other hand, redemption of 100 PAX tokens results in destruction of those 100 tokens and withdrawal of $100 from the reserve to be given to the redeemer. As a resort to critical security threat, Paxos can pause transfer and approval of PAX tokens via OpenZeppelin’s contracts.\n\nAlthough the creation and deletion of the tokens occur through Paxos, other transactions in PAX follow ERC-20 smart contracts. This ensures security for PAX, as it gets rid of the need for third parties and instead relies on the long-tested global blockchain network. Additionally, trading tokens is simple with PAX because viewing and transferring of PAX is automatically supported by most Ethereum-supporting exchanges and wallet applications.\n\nDue to the Trust Charter, the New York State Department of Financial Services regulates and monitors the company and its operating procedures to make sure it follows New York banking laws. These banking laws also requires PAX to have the power to freeze accounts as well as wipe the balance of said frozen accounts. PAX has a function called “setLawEnforcementRole.” As its name implies, it can give administrative permissions over the circulating PAX supply. Paxos has assured that the function is for preventing illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing and that it will not be used unless required by law. \n\nPaxos Standard smart contract has been audited by Nomic Labs to ensure that the contract works as intended and advertised, and PAX ERC-20 contract code is available for technical reviews on Github. Moreover, Withum, a nationally ranked Top 25 auditing firm, confirms that dollar deposits match PAX tokens in circulation on a monthly basis for greater transparency.\n",

It uses an automated market maker (AMM) model that resembles the first iterations of Bancor (BNT) or Uniswap where THORChain's native token (RUNE) will be the base swap pair. This model allows traders to move between different asset pools using RUNE as a somewhat hidden intermediary. It also rewards liquidity providers (LPs), those that deposit or “stake” assets on either side of a liquidity pool, with a portion of trading fees.\n\nIt uses an AMM model to facilitate cryptoasset swaps\nan independent cryptonetwork that aims to enable the exchange of assets across disparate blockchain networks in a non-custodial manner. Its protocol features a cross-chain bridge system (known as the  Bifröst Protocol) to connect different chains. THORChain also uses an adapted version of Bancor's \"smart tokens,\" which it calls Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs), to facilitate the exchange of assets. The key difference is that CLPs reward users for contributing to the liquidity in each pool. THORChain features a native token, RUNE, that owners can use to participate in the network or add to a liquidity pool.",

            "background_details": "The THORChain project was founded in 2018 under the premise that the use of centralized exchanges to transfer cryptoassets between different blockchains was flawed. Non-custodial exchanges, otherwise known as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), were the long-term solution. Therefore, the THORChain team set out to build an independent blockchain that could bridge to external networks and thus facilitate cross-chain transfers, functioning similarly to a DEX.\n\nThe problem often facing DEXs is finding sufficient liquidity. Traders gravitate towards platforms where they won't lose any value due to slippage. But these same traders are the ones to provide enough liquidity to prevent slippage in the first place. In response, the THORChain team plans to implement an adapted model of Bancor's \"smart token\" to create what it calls Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs). These pools of available assets give traders access to liquidity without needing to find or contact another buyer or seller.\n\nTHORChain also distributes rewards in the form of RUNE (the network's native token) to any user that adds tokens to a liquidity pool. At the same time, token owners can stake their assets and earn the fees accumulated from other users accessing the pool.\n\nTHORChain is a Tendermint-based chain, and therefore uses Tendermint BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) as its consensus mechanism. It also employs Proof-of-Stake (PoS) for Sybil resistance. As part of the PoS element, a system of validators can stake RUNE tokens to run network nodes and validate transactions. THORChain allows token holders to delegate to these validators, which keeps validators in check and permits delegators to a portion of each block reward.\n\nThe project is looking to launch its mainnet at some point in 2021. It has also launched an AMM on Binance Chain called BEPSwap.",

The project opted to distribute these assets through a few tokens sales, a reward mechanism for providing liquidity, and direct allocations to early contributors. THORChain also has an incentive model for node operators, whereby these participants can earn rewards from a pool of pre-minted tokens once the network launches.\n\nIn Oct. 2019, THORChain opted to burn all of the \"unused\" reserve RUNE, which when combined with the ~15 million tokens burned through Project Surtr, amounted to 50% of the initial max supply. The supply reduction did not impact the tokens already distributed to Pre-Sale and Initial DEX Offering (IDO) investors. The allocation of the original, pre-minted RUNE supply, as well as the post-burn amounts, are as follows:\nService nodes: 500 million (220,447,472 RUNE post-burn) to reward network validators and liquidity contributors\nOperational reserves (THORChain company): 130 million (65 million post-burn) to use for Staff incentives, other sales, and liquidity bootstrapping\nCommunity reserves (RUNEVault): 120 million (now 60 million)\nTeam & Advisors: 100 million (now 50 million)\nSeed investors: 60 million (now 30 million)\nPre-Sale (Private Sale) investors: 70 million\nInitial DEX Offering (IDO): 7 million (of the 20 million offered in the sale, 13 million went unsold and were later burned)\n\nToken sales\nTHORChain kicked off RUNE distribution through what it called an Initial DEX Offering (IDO). The sale ran on Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange launched by Binance on its blockchain network (aptly named Binance Chain). THORChain sold 7 million RUNE (out of a proposed 20 million) during the IDO at an average price of  $0.032, raising $224,000 worth of BNB in the process.\n\nThe project also completed a Seed round and a pre-sale before launching its IDO. The Seed round distributed 60 million RUNE priced at $0.01, while the pre-sale sold 70 million tokens at a 30% max discount compared to the IDO price (which was about $0.023).\n\nCommunity reserves\nMost (if not all) of the Community Reserve will go through RUNEVault, a user interface that allows users to stake their RUNE on Binance Chain in exchange for pre-minted RUNE rewards.

The supply reduction did not impact the tokens already distributed to Pre-Sale and Initial DEX Offering (IDO) investors. The allocation of the original and post-burn amounts, along with their vesting schedules, are as follows:\nService nodes & liquidity incentives: 220,447,472 RUNE (initially 500 million) of ongoing emissions through validator rewards and liquidity pool provisioning incentives\nOperational reserves (THORChain company): 65 million (initially 130 million) that vest monthly over 40 months (3.5 years) since initial distribution. THORChain may also use tokens from this pool for OTC sales to strategic partners.\nCommunity reserves (RUNEVault): 60 million (initially 120 million) emitted over 2.5 years through the RUNEVault rewards program and airdrop events\nTeam & Advisors: 50 million (initially 100 million), which are locked until mainnet launch, then released in 20% batches every three months\nSeed investors: 30 million (initially 60 million), of which four million were distributed immediately. The rest of the tokens will remain locked until mainnet launch, then released in 20% batches every three months\nPre-Sale (Private Sale) investors: 70 million. 50% of this pool was unlocked upon distribution to provide enough liquidity on Binance DEX. The other half unlocked one week after the close of THORChain's initial DEX offering (IDO).\nInitial DEX Offering (IDO): 20 million, of which 13 million went unsold and were later burned, that came with no vesting schedule\n\nOngoing emissions\nTHORChain includes a few ongoing emission models to incentivize network participation:\nRUNEVault issues two million RUNE tokens each month as part of its staking rewards program. This issuance will continue until the Community reserves (60 million total tokens) runs out, which would allow the RUNEVault program to operate for about 2.5 years after its launch. Note that THORChain could revisit this model in the future with community input to reduce reserve emission.\nService nodes and liquidity provisioners will receive monthly distributions equal to the below block rewards calculation. Two-thirds of this block reward will go to service nodes (aka validators), and the remaining third will go towards liquidity incentives. Block rewards will continue until this bucket's max supply of 220,447,472 RUNE is reached.\nblockRewardsPerMonth = maxSupply - circulatingSupply) / (6 * 12)\n\nProject Surtr (The RUNE burn program)\nTHORChain introduced Project Sutr in Aug. 2019, which aims to burn any unused RUNE from the various token reserves. On the 20th of every month, the team gathers input from the community to determine whether unallocated RUNE should be burned.

            "technology_details": "THORChain uses a series of core technologies to ensure the network functions as designed:\nTendermint\nContinuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs)\nBifröst Protocol\nYggdrasil Protocol\n\nTendermint\nTHORChain is a Tendermint-based chain, which is the same architecture and consensus system first used by the Cosmos network. Tendermint employs its own BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus mechanism that relies on synchronicity. Therefore, like Cosmos, THORChain caps the number of validators (100 to start) in order to reach finality for each proposed block. It also supports a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism since Tendmint requires each Validator to have a weight on the network determined by the stake they hold.\n\nContinuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs)\nThe THORChain team plans to implement an adapted model of Bancor's \"smart token\" to create what it calls Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs). This system incentivizes participants to supply liquidity in exchange for fees and RUNE rewards. Traders can then access and exchange with these token pools directly, which gives CLPs an on-going supply of liquidity. The protocol also tracks the ratio of RUNE to the asset held in each CLP, which creates an inherent on-chain price feed for individual assets.\n\nBifröst Protocol\nThe Bifröst Protocol is THORChain's cross-chain bridging system. The protocol leverages THORChain's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validator set, the on-chain price feeds generated by CLPs, multi-signature (multi-sig) accounts to create and secure these bridges. Every bridge uses validating parties to verify transactions. But the multi-sig system randomly assigns validators to each transaction to limit centralization concerns. Each bridge is customizable, where the end-user determines the number of parties required to sign-off on a transaction (a three-of-four multi-sig arrangement is less secure but faster than a 20-of-21 schema). The Bifröst Protocol also uses the on-chain price feeds created by CLPs to give each bridge a security profile (how likely is a bridge to fail) and to identify and punish bridge validators that act against the network's rules.\n\nYggdrasil Protocol\nThe Yggdrasil Protocol is a sharding mechanism designed to help scale THORChain. Unlike more traditional sharding applications, which split items into horizontal components, the Yggdrasil Protocol uses a vertical sharding technique on entire chains. The team says this technique allows THORChain to apply sharding to cross-chain ecosystems, as opposed to sharding an existing chain. As for shard consensus, THORChain does not engage the full Validator Set to monitor each shard. Only a subset of validators will finalize cross-shard transactions. But the others will be able to monitor the consensus reached on every shard.",

It aims to include and empower the three main network participants: Validators, Standby Validators, and Delegators.\n\nThe voting and delegation model is similar to systems seen in Tezos or Cosmos. THORChain validators can accept delegations from any RUNE token holder, thus boosting their overall stake and voting power. But block rewards get evenly distributed among validators, incentivizing delegators to seek out validators with a lower stake weight. The design aims to minimize voting power centralization at the top of the Validator Set (i.e., the top 100 validators). Prospective validators that exist outside of the top 100 are known are Standby Validators.\n\n__Two-layer design__\nThe *Æ*sir protocol consists of two distinct layers. One allows for delegators to vote on proposals (or submit a proposal) inside of a Staking Pool. The other layer lets Validators \"signal\" the voting results from each Staking Pool to see if a network-wide change has either passed or failed.\n\nThe validator for each Staking Pool can vote on behalf of every active delegator should they choose not to participate. [This mechanism](https://medium.com/thorchain/governing-thorchain-b04f1f0f656f) \"serves as a hybrid between direct and representative democracy.\" But the goal is to achieve 100% voter turnout within each pool. THORChain also plans to implement [Quadratic Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) within Staking Pools to inhibit plutocracies. As part of the network's consensus mechanism, delegators can re-delegate at any time. Staking Pool votes must achieve a simple majority (51% threshold) to pass and move on to the Validator signaling stage.\n\nAs for the signaling layer, Validators will be able to read all current proposals as well as nominate their own changes each block. Unlike the Staking Pools, proposals at the Validator level must receive a supermajority (two-thirds or 67%) for the change to take effect. Validators that don't participate in the signaling period will get part of their stake slashed and redistributed to other Validators.\n\nValidators can also implement a grace period prior to voting, depending on the severity of the proposed amendment. Similar to Tezos, THORChain validators can opt to run \"sweeping architectural changes\" on the project's testnet before implementing them to the mainnet.",

BSV's ethos is to \"restore what was the original Bitcoin protocol.\" The decision to <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork\">hard fork</a> from Bitcoin Cash was a result of a dispute over canonical transaction ordering which would enable the graphene algorithm to run more efficiently and script enhancements enabling oracle data to be imported to the blockchain. In opposition, Bitcoin SV rejected these proposals and instead planned to increase the block limit to 128MB (later increased to 512MB in a hard fork) and restore certain opcodes from the original Bitcoin 0.1.0 protocol implementation.  Although increased block capacity could increase transaction throughput on-chain, it could potentially restrict the universe of participants who could be capable of running full <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\">nodes</a>, thus making this something the community needs to address in order to be able to execute on its vision of a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system. \n\nOn November 15, 2018, Bitcoin Cash split into two with the Bitcoin ABC faction, the leading Bitcoin Cash client, ultimately winning the majority of the networks hashrate and retaining the name Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin SV is led by <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/nchain\">nChain</a>, a research and development technology firm building tools, protocols, and applications to support blockchain growth worldwide.",

A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (mempool) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin SV's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Bitcoin SV uses a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\">Proof-of-Work</a> (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain.

Flow uses a multi-role architecture design to scale the network instead of sharding. One of the fundamental reasons Dapper Labs opted to shift away from Ethereum and build its own general-purpose blockchain was to avoid the complexity of sharding. Flow asserts that its scaling-without-sharding strategy will improve network speed and throughput while preserving composability standards and a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.",

This includes complete implementations of protocol logic for each of the various node types, integration of the Hot Stuff consensus algorithm, and implementation of the various crypto libraries and signatures the protocol requires. The team released the Flow Beta Mainnet in May which supports production user experiences for us and its partners. \n\nFor Beta Mainnet the native token (FLOW) existed on the network to instantiate user accounts and provide a minimal balance for user to conduct their first transactions. All fees were a small nominal amount at this stage.  Future development will include integration of epochs (the ability for new nodes to join and leave the protocol), full challenge arbitration by the consensus nodes, performance improvements to the protocol, and upgrades to the programming language (Cadence).

As a general rule, their investments focus on equity in companies rather than tokens, though they do purchase and hold cryptocurrencies. DCG also owns and operates CoinDesk, a well-known media company in the space, Genesis Trading, a bitcoin brokerage firm, and Grayscale Investments, a digital currency asset management firm. DCG has made over 100 investments in the space including well-known startups like Protocol Labs, Coinbase, and Ripple."

During the bootstrapping phase, at least 20M FLOW tokens will be distributed, representing approximately 1.6% monetary inflation. Staking rewards begin accruing after November 2, 2020 and are paid out every epoch (approximately weekly).\n\nLong Term\nNew issuance on Flow is used for staking rewards in cases when transaction fees are not sufficient to compensate delegators and validator node operators. On or before December 15, 2020, the total new issuance rate across the network is capped at 5% per year. This cap will go down to 3% after June 1, 2022. New issuance “tops up” the transaction fees to a minimum guaranteed income for node operators. If fees cover the income guarantees, new issuance goes to 0. Therefore, as the Flow blockchain gains adoption and fees increase, the issuance should eventually remain at zero while fees make up a majority of network rewards.”\n\nNote: There is an additional 250 million FLOW tokens, half of which will be held in the foundation reserve for staking and delegation only while the other half is intended as collateral subsidies to secondary protocols. As a result of the intended lockup, these tokens are not reflected in the circulating supply. ",

            "technology_details": "There are four pillars at the foundation of the Flow blockchain:\nMulti-role architecture\nResource-oriented programming\nDeveloper ergonomics\nConsumer onboarding\n\nMulti-role architecture\nFlow’s design is unique, allowing the network to scale to serve billions of users without sharding or reducing the decentralization of consensus. Flow pipelines the work of a blockchain miner or validator across four different roles that all require staking; a separation of concerns that significantly reduces redundant effort. Epochs will reflect the plans outlined in this document - Incentives in a Multi-Role Blockchain while challenge arbitration will in Flow is described in this technical paper - Execution Verification. \n\nResource-oriented programming\nSmart contracts on Flow are written in Cadence, a new programming language for cryptoassets and apps that builds on the concepts of resource-oriented programming which prioritizes ease of use for developers. Using Cadence, developers will be able to create unique and durable digital artifacts where ownership is tracked by the language itself. Flow envisions that this design will enable a powerful new category of applications. Developers can try Cadence on the Flow Playground.\n\nDeveloper ergonomics\nFlow includes a number of features informed by Dapper Labs’ experience building some of the most used dapps of all time, including CryptoKitties. For example, Flow enables upgradeable smart contracts to allow developers to deploy smart contracts to the mainnet in a “beta state”, where the code can be incrementally updated by the original authors. Users will be alerted to the unfinished nature of this code, and can choose to wait until the code is finalized before interacting with it. Once authors are confident that their code is safe, they can irrevocably release their control on the contract, and then remains immutable on the Flow blockchain for all time. This balances the best-practices of product development (early iteration and refinement) with the smart contract benefits of trustless, immortal code.\n\nConsumer onboarding\nThe native account model on Flow is designed to provide a series of benefits to improve the experience for all users, from rank beginners to seasoned experts. For example, there are hooks built into the protocol to allow account recovery flows for users who lose their keys and optional multi-sig support with the ability to frequently cycle keys for advanced use cases.\n\nGeneral Tech stack overview\nThe entirety of the node software is currently written in the Go programming language. This includes basic storage (BadgerDB), networking (libp2p), consensus algorithm (self implemented HotStuff), execution storage (self implemented binary Merkle tree), execution environment (Cadence) and all supporting components.\n\nThe codebase is generally split into sections related to each of the roles: Access, Collection, Consensus, Execution and Verification, with the exception being shared components, such as caching, networking and cryptography.\n\nThe Flow blockchain programming language, Cadence lives in a separate repo and is maintained separately.",

The Flow GitHub repository is currently under the control of the Core Team.\nMembers of the Flow Ecosystem discuss a submitted proposal; during this process, anyone may propose modifications to the originally submitted proposal\nEventually, it is determined whether there is community consensus to implement a given proposal\nIf and once community consensus forms around a proposal, the Core Team authorizes and implements the changes in a set of compatible protocol definitions and software implementations so they can be deployed by Validators maintaining the Flow Blockchain.

Helium believes that today's wireless connectivity options are wholely inadequate for the next generation of machines. To solve this they developed the Helium Hotspot, a combination of a physical blockchain node and wireless gateway that network participants can deploy to receive compensation in HNT, the native token. In order to receive rewards, Hotspots must submit proof of wireless coverage in a cryptographically verified location and time. Once the network is deployed, any sensor using the Helium LongFi wireless protocol can connect to the network which is intended for battery-powered devices sending small amounts of data over miles of range.  \n\nHotspots are rewarded in HNT based on the quality of the coverage they provide and the amount of LongFi sensor data they transport for devices on the network. HNT is burned to create Data Credits, a non-fungible token used for all transaction fees on the network. Data Credits are required for things like sending sensor data and asserting Hotspot location. Any LongFi-enabled IoT device can send data through any Helium Hotspot that's providing coverage.\n",

The likelihood of participating in this consensus process is based on a reputation score that changes based on Proof-of-Coverage participation\nChallenges: Hotspots are chosen to encrypt messages over the Internet to a target group of Hotspots. These challenges are used by Proof-of-Coverage to validate wireless coverage. "

Knowing where, when and how strongly a signal was received allows for verification of the transmitter location. Hotspots are constantly challenged by the Helium blockchain to prove their coverage, and they carry a score that floats dynamically between 0.0 and 1. This score represents the Network's confidence in their location as derived from those challenges, and thus the quality of their Helium LongFi wireless coverage\n\nConsensus is reached using the Helium Consensus Protocol. It works by having the best proofs of coverage from the prior epoch elect members for the next one who then runs a distributed key generator to bootstrap their threshold encryption keys. Each member accepts transactions until they have a certain amount in their queue, then encrypts them with the threshold public key and gossips encrypted data around. Once members all share their proposed transactions, they are all threshold decrypted at which point they cannot be censored. The transactions are deduplicated, invalid ones removed, and they are combined into a new block. This block then has a threshold signature applied to it. Members trying to censor transactions will end up with a different block than honest nodes and thus their signature shares won’t be valid.\n\nHelium provides coverage using LongFi, an open-source protocol in the Sub-GHz frequency band. Using LongFi any device can broadcast a message within the coverage area of the Helium network and have their message relayed to a web server for a fee. \n",

The founding team launched the network to address the shortcomings of existing blockchain platforms, which had limited business adoption up to that point. Consequently, Waves focused on speed, scalability, security and user experience.\n\nThe Waves network was launched in Q3 2016 with the ability to facilitate token creation and the management of digital tokens. In 2017, Waves started a collaboration with Microsoft Azure and became an official partner of Deloitte. It also implemented a new consensus protocol, Waves-NG, based on Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer’s Bitcoin-NG proposal, towards the end of the year. Waves-NG increased transaction throughput up to 100 tx/second. In 2018, the company released a new mobile application, which made most of Waves' most popular features available for smartphone and tablet users.\n\nToday, the platform offers purpose-designed tools to facilitate the process of developing and running dApps, and hosts various applications and use cases – from a <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-exchanges\">decentralized exchange (DEX</a>) and algorithmic <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/stablecoins\">stablecoins</a> to <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/dao\">DAOs</a>, encrypted messaging, and gaming.",

            "technology_details": "Waves is a multi-purpose blockchain platform that strives to combine on-chain governance and blockchain-based programming with the ability to conduct formal verification. It is an open Leased-Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) blockchain, in which participants can act as forgers (validators) if they hold a certain amount of tokens or lease their tokens to validators. The consensus mechanism also features a community-driven monetary policy, with block rewards decided by forgers and an activation protocol to vote on new features being launched onto the network.\n\nThe Waves-NG protocol, adapted from Emin Gün Sirer’s Bitcoin-NG proposal, was implemented on mainnet in 2017 to enhance transaction throughput and reduce latencies. Unlike Ethereum (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">$ETH</a>), Waves transactions have fixed fees and no variable gas-like requirements.\n\nRide, Waves’ smart contract programming language, was inspired by Scala and created specifically for dApp development. Ride is a non-Turing complete and human-readable language equipped with Formal Verification and designed to make the process of learning and development faster. The incorporation of Formal Verification is meant to protect developers from various common mistakes which can lead to unintended consequences in <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\">smart contracts</a> and potential loss of funds. Ride is suitable for building <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/dao\">DAOs</a>, Escrow facilities, Referral and Loyalty systems, Marketplaces, Digital Securities, P2P-lending, Gaming, Identity, and many other applications.\n\nThe available developer tools include Waves IDE for sandbox development, the Visual Studio code plugin for advanced users, an Oracle protocol, and tools to connect <a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\">dApps</a> to data sources. Waves also offers a native desktop and mobile Client for accessing certain platform features, including token creation and operations, sending and exchanging tokens, and leasing WAVES. Waves Keeper, a browser plug-in similar to Ethereum’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/organization/metamask\">MetaMask</a>, allows users to interact with Waves-enabled websites and dApps.\n\nThe platform provided a decentralized exchange, known as Waves DEX, for crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat trading. But continuous delays and issues related to tech support led the Waves team to spin Waves DEX into Waves Exchange. The new exchange will employ a hybrid approach, keeping the features of Waves DEX considered essential like non-custodial asset storage while introducing centralized tools to improve user experience.",

Protocol changes do not activate once merged, however, as at least 80% of network miners must first accept the changes and download the new code to initiate the update. Once the miners vote in favor of an update, the new network functions become available to all network users and developers.\n\nLearn more:\nWEP Discussion Board",

The new policy introduced a block reward, changing Waves' emission schedule from fixed to inflationary, and allowed block generators to vote on whether their reward should increase or decrease. Voting takes place at the end of every 100,000 block period, lasting 10,000 blocks. During this time, block generators can opt to increase or decrease the block reward by only 0.5 WAVES. Over half of all block generators must vote in favor of an issuance change, otherwise, the reward schedule will remain the same.",

In the Tangle there are no blocks or miners, and every transaction on the Iota network must validate two previous transactions through a small proof-of-work (PoW). Thus the more transactions occur, the faster the network can process new transactions, theoretically allowing the network to become more efficient as it scales.   ",

            "background_details": "Jinn\nIOTA traces its roots back to the Jinn project, a project revealed-jinn/?PHPSESSID=nq858u49belilo9p40u0evbsk7) to the world in September 2014 on an NXT forum. The project aimed to develop a new efficient micro processor for IoT devices based on trinary (rather than binary) calculation methods. In order to finance R&D of the hardware project, the Jinn team held a crowd sale for in September 2014, selling ~100,000 JINN tokens (10% of the total) for 8,5000,000 <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/nxt\">NXT</a> worth $250,000 at the time. The JINN tokens were launched on the NXT platform and represented a share in the profits of the Jinn company. \n\nHowever, fearing regulatory issues surrounding their JINN, which represented a claim on the Jinn's profits, the Jinn team pivoted. On a BitcoinTalk forum in 2015, the Jinn founders announced a new project called IOTA. IOTA aimed to be \"a brand new and novel micro-transaction cryptotoken optimized for the Internet-of-Things (IoT).\" According to Jinn founder Sønstebø, \"...it only makes sense first to introduce IOTA and then Jinn afterwards.\" \n\nIOTA Crowdsale\nThe team similarly did a crowdsale for their IOTA token, which instead of being a profit sharing token like JINN, was a utility token used for payment on the IOTA network. IOTA sold 999,999,999 tokens in its 2015 crowdsale raising a total of 1,337 Bitcoin, equivalent to $434,000 at the time. Jinn token holders were also allowed to participate in the IOTA crowdsale by converting their JINN tokens for IOTA at a fixed exchange rate of 0.0063BTC per JINN. The supply was later changed to 2.78 billion IOTA. According to IOTA documentation the token supply was increased because “high supply makes IOTA optimal for tiny nano transactions while still keeping efficiency in mind.“ 5% of the funds from the IOTA's token offering were later donated to the IOTA Foundation, which was formally announced in October 2017.\n\nMainnet Launch\nIn July 2016, IOTA launched on Mainet. The project aimed to provide distributed ledger technology for the internet-of-things (IoT) space where small connected devices regularly share data. Because these devices are generally specialized to be low power and application specific IOTA does not use a traditional consensus mechanism like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake nor does it use a blockchain structure. The goal of the project is to allow these devices to conduct micropayment transactions between themselves and potentially to securely transfer data. \n\nAt the core of the project is what is referred to as the 'Tangle,' a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that acts as the public ledger system. The team believes that this structure will allow for feeless payments, lower compute cost, and the ability to connect to billions of devices. The efficiency of this system also grows as the number of participants increases as transactions will be processed at a faster rate. One of the project's more recent releases was a data marketplace that allows for storing and selling data streams while masking the source of the data.\n\nIOTA is currently developed and supported by the IOTA foundation, a German non-profit. In July 2019, Iota co-founder Sergey Ivancheglo stepped down from the IOTA Foundation.",

This is achieved by \ffinding a nonce such that the hash of that nonce concatenated with some data from the approved transaction has a particular form. It is assumed that nodes individually check to see if any transactions are conflicting. There are no rewards for validating transactions or incentives for running full nodes.\n\nAs transactions receive additional approvals, they are accepted by the system with a higher level of confidence.As transactions gain additional approvals they gain weight, which is proportional to the amount of work that the issuing node invested into it.

            "technology_details": "IOTA's is a distributed ledger, the Tangle, is based on a data structure referred to as a <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/directed-acyclic-graph-dag\">Directed Acyclic Graph</a> (DAG) rather than a blockchain. In the Tangle there are no blocks or miners, and every transaction on the Iota network must validate two previous transactions through a small proof-of-work (PoW). Therefore, users who issue a transactions are contributing to the network's security. Transaction on IOTA are stored in the tangle graph, which is the ledger for storing transactions.  \n\nThe main idea of the tangle is the following: to issue a transaction, users must work to approve other transactions. Once transactions are confirmed, they are broadcast to the entire network, where another unconfirmed transaction can decided to approve the newly confirmed transaction. It is assumed that the nodes check if the approved transactions are not conflicting. If a node \fadds that a transaction is in conflict with the tangle history, the node will not approve the conflicting transaction in either a direct or indirect manner. As transactions receive additional approvals, they are accepted by the system with a higher level of confidence.  \n\nApprovals add \"weight\" to a transaction. The weight of a transaction is proportional to the amount of work that the issuing node invested into it. it. Transactions with larger weights are more important than transactions with a smaller weight. Transactions accumulate weight over time. A transaction's cumulative weight is the weight of the transaction plus the sum of weights of all transactions that directly or indirectly approve this transaction. The time is takes for transactions to get approved is inversely proportional to the amount transactions being issued on the network. Once transactions are approved their weight will grow at the rate of the incoming flow of transactions. \n\nAlthough not mentioned in the whitepaper, the IOTA network currently relies on a coordinator node that provides trusted milestone transactions, and snapshots which are used to reduce the size of the network. The coordinator node is a special node that is operated by the IOTA foundation designed to protect the IOTA network from attacks while it grows. The coordinator node issues milestones every minute, which reference valid transactions. Milestones are special transactions published by the Coordinator that keep the Tangle from branching out too widely, which could result in bifurcations of the ledger. It effectively pulls branches back to the main tangle, resolving potential double spends in the process. Transactions on IOTA are only treated as confirmed if they are referenced by a milestone. All nodes running the IOTA software treat all transactions referenced by the coordinated as valid. \n\nSnapshots are periodic events triggered solely by the IOTA Foundation that delete all zero balances in the system and restart the Tangle from a ‘new Genesis’. Occurring roughly every month, snapshots aim to reduce the size of the IOTA network, preventing it from bloating. Full Nodes in IOTA only store the history up to the latest Snapshot.\n\nIOTA plans to remove the coordinator once the network reaches scale. Furthermore, it eventually plans to incentivize full nodes to store the entire Tangle history beyond snapshots issued by the IOTA foundation.  \n",
